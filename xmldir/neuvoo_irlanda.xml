In fact, we're one of the most successful online education companies of any kind. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To stay at the top, we need help with hiring the best people for our team. And that's why we're looking for a &lt;b&gt;Hiring Specialist&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; 7 Reasons To Join iPhone Photography &lt;br/&gt;School As A Hiring Specialist &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 1 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Develop A Highly Marketable Skill Set In Hiring &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you know how to hire people, you’ll never be out of work. That's because every company in the world needs help with hiring. It's that simple. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But most companies don't know how to hire well. We know this because we used to be one of those companies. We’ve made so many embarrassing hiring mistakes... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Thankfully, we've learned from our mistakes. It took us 5 years and tens of thousands of job applications… But now we have one of the most efficient hiring machines in the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you want to become a hiring expert, there’s no better place to do it than with us. &lt;/p&gt; 2 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Help Brilliant People Find Their Dream Jobs &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One of the things you love the most about hiring is the people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Meeting and getting to know job applicants from all walks of life is incredibly exciting. And helping them with something as important as finding a job is truly rewarding. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We’re always looking for brilliant people to join our team. And we can offer them something very few companies can. Many of our employees say they have found their dream jobs with us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll be helping brilliant people find their dream jobs. &lt;/p&gt; 3 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Take Our Company To The Next Level &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We've been the subject of dozens of magazine articles, TV news segments, online videos and awards. People are fascinated by our success so far. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But we're only getting started. We're about to take online education to a whole new level. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Currently, our team is just 19 people. To achieve our ambitious goals we’ll need to hire many more. And these hires will make or break the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That means your work will be critical to the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; 4 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stay In Control Of Your Schedule &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every job will occasionally have emergencies and important deadlines causing you to work long hours. That's normal. But it becomes a problem when long hours are the norm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That's not how we choose to work. We want (and even ask) our team members NOT to work long hours. That's because we're building our team for the long run. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join our team, and you’ll stay in charge of your schedule. &lt;/p&gt; 5 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stability You Can Count On &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Most startups have huge ambitions – but little or no revenue. If you've spent years of your life in an exciting new project that never really took off, you already know how frustrating it can be. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School has been highly profitable for years. We’ve never taken investor money. Our rapid growth has been funded by sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; You won’t have to worry about our company running out of money. &lt;/p&gt; 6 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Perks That Make A Difference &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To get the best results, we have to offer the best possible work conditions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Things like a top-of-the-line laptop, automated solutions for repetitive tasks, and investing in your education make your work more valuable. So providing them is a no-brainer for us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We also want you to have a sense of belonging to our team. Even if you work remotely, you'll get to meet your coworkers in person at our regular team retreats. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Whether it's rafting through the wilderness, sailing to a remote island, or participating in an ancient sauna ritual, you’ll remember these adventures for years to come. &lt;/p&gt; 7 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Join A Company You Truly Believe In &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Many people don't believe that their company creates a positive impact on the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But our company is different. We help millions of people take better photos. And we make the most beautiful online courses in the world (you can watch a sample video below). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every week we receive hundreds of heartfelt thank-you notes from our students saying we helped fill their lives with the joy of photography. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll work for a company you truly believe in. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; What Will You &lt;br/&gt; Do As A &lt;br/&gt; Hiring &lt;br/&gt; Specialist? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We get more than a thousand job applications each month. This number will continue to grow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Your job will be to review these applications and decide whether we want to continue the hiring process with each candidate. You’ll also interview the successful candidates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Over time, we'll be happy for you to take on more responsibilities in hiring. The more steps of the hiring process you can handle independently, the better it is for the company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Here’s What We Expect From You &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;li&gt; We can trust your decisions in the hiring process &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can carry out professional job interviews independently &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have the patience to go through hundreds of job applications per day &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can “sell” our company to job applicants &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have an eye for what makes a photograph or a video clip visually appealing (you’ll often have to evaluate applications for visual jobs such as video editor) &lt;/li&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is a full-time position. You can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our beautiful office in Riga, Latvia, or any paradise location. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you delay submitting your application, &lt;br/&gt; someone else will be hired before you. &lt;/p&gt;]]></content>

In fact, we're one of the most successful online education companies of any kind. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To stay at the top, we need help with hiring the best people for our team. And that's why we're looking for a &lt;b&gt;Hiring Specialist&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; 7 Reasons To Join iPhone Photography &lt;br/&gt;School As A Hiring Specialist &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 1 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Develop A Highly Marketable Skill Set In Hiring &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you know how to hire people, you’ll never be out of work. That's because every company in the world needs help with hiring. It's that simple. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But most companies don't know how to hire well. We know this because we used to be one of those companies. We’ve made so many embarrassing hiring mistakes... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Thankfully, we've learned from our mistakes. It took us 5 years and tens of thousands of job applications… But now we have one of the most efficient hiring machines in the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you want to become a hiring expert, there’s no better place to do it than with us. &lt;/p&gt; 2 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Help Brilliant People Find Their Dream Jobs &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One of the things you love the most about hiring is the people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Meeting and getting to know job applicants from all walks of life is incredibly exciting. And helping them with something as important as finding a job is truly rewarding. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We’re always looking for brilliant people to join our team. And we can offer them something very few companies can. Many of our employees say they have found their dream jobs with us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll be helping brilliant people find their dream jobs. &lt;/p&gt; 3 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Take Our Company To The Next Level &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We've been the subject of dozens of magazine articles, TV news segments, online videos and awards. People are fascinated by our success so far. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But we're only getting started. We're about to take online education to a whole new level. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Currently, our team is just 19 people. To achieve our ambitious goals we’ll need to hire many more. And these hires will make or break the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That means your work will be critical to the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; 4 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stay In Control Of Your Schedule &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every job will occasionally have emergencies and important deadlines causing you to work long hours. That's normal. But it becomes a problem when long hours are the norm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That's not how we choose to work. We want (and even ask) our team members NOT to work long hours. That's because we're building our team for the long run. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join our team, and you’ll stay in charge of your schedule. &lt;/p&gt; 5 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stability You Can Count On &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Most startups have huge ambitions – but little or no revenue. If you've spent years of your life in an exciting new project that never really took off, you already know how frustrating it can be. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School has been highly profitable for years. We’ve never taken investor money. Our rapid growth has been funded by sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; You won’t have to worry about our company running out of money. &lt;/p&gt; 6 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Perks That Make A Difference &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To get the best results, we have to offer the best possible work conditions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Things like a top-of-the-line laptop, automated solutions for repetitive tasks, and investing in your education make your work more valuable. So providing them is a no-brainer for us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We also want you to have a sense of belonging to our team. Even if you work remotely, you'll get to meet your coworkers in person at our regular team retreats. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Whether it's rafting through the wilderness, sailing to a remote island, or participating in an ancient sauna ritual, you’ll remember these adventures for years to come. &lt;/p&gt; 7 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Join A Company You Truly Believe In &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Many people don't believe that their company creates a positive impact on the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But our company is different. We help millions of people take better photos. And we make the most beautiful online courses in the world (you can watch a sample video below). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every week we receive hundreds of heartfelt thank-you notes from our students saying we helped fill their lives with the joy of photography. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll work for a company you truly believe in. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; What Will You &lt;br/&gt; Do As A &lt;br/&gt; Hiring &lt;br/&gt; Specialist? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We get more than a thousand job applications each month. This number will continue to grow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Your job will be to review these applications and decide whether we want to continue the hiring process with each candidate. You’ll also interview the successful candidates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Over time, we'll be happy for you to take on more responsibilities in hiring. The more steps of the hiring process you can handle independently, the better it is for the company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Here’s What We Expect From You &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;li&gt; We can trust your decisions in the hiring process &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can carry out professional job interviews independently &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have the patience to go through hundreds of job applications per day &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can “sell” our company to job applicants &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have an eye for what makes a photograph or a video clip visually appealing (you’ll often have to evaluate applications for visual jobs such as video editor) &lt;/li&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is a full-time position. You can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our beautiful office in Riga, Latvia, or any paradise location. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you delay submitting your application, &lt;br/&gt; someone else will be hired before you. &lt;/p&gt;]]></content>

  <content><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; You’ve finally &lt;br/&gt;found it… &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The perfect job opportunity to skyrocket your career in hiring. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If that's what you've been looking for, &lt;b&gt;then this page could literally change your life!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But only if you keep reading. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; iPhone Photography School is the world's leading resource on iPhone photography. In fact, we're one of the most successful online education companies of any kind. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To stay at the top, we need help with hiring the best people for our team. And that's why we're looking for a &lt;b&gt;Hiring Specialist&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; 7 Reasons To Join iPhone Photography &lt;br/&gt;School As A Hiring Specialist &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 1 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Develop A Highly Marketable Skill Set In Hiring &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you know how to hire people, you’ll never be out of work. That's because every company in the world needs help with hiring. It's that simple. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But most companies don't know how to hire well. We know this because we used to be one of those companies. We’ve made so many embarrassing hiring mistakes... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Thankfully, we've learned from our mistakes. It took us 5 years and tens of thousands of job applications… But now we have one of the most efficient hiring machines in the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you want to become a hiring expert, there’s no better place to do it than with us. &lt;/p&gt; 2 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Help Brilliant People Find Their Dream Jobs &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One of the things you love the most about hiring is the people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Meeting and getting to know job applicants from all walks of life is incredibly exciting. And helping them with something as important as finding a job is truly rewarding. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We’re always looking for brilliant people to join our team. And we can offer them something very few companies can. Many of our employees say they have found their dream jobs with us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll be helping brilliant people find their dream jobs. &lt;/p&gt; 3 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Take Our Company To The Next Level &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We've been the subject of dozens of magazine articles, TV news segments, online videos and awards. People are fascinated by our success so far. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But we're only getting started. We're about to take online education to a whole new level. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Currently, our team is just 19 people. To achieve our ambitious goals we’ll need to hire many more. And these hires will make or break the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That means your work will be critical to the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; 4 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stay In Control Of Your Schedule &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every job will occasionally have emergencies and important deadlines causing you to work long hours. That's normal. But it becomes a problem when long hours are the norm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That's not how we choose to work. We want (and even ask) our team members NOT to work long hours. That's because we're building our team for the long run. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join our team, and you’ll stay in charge of your schedule. &lt;/p&gt; 5 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stability You Can Count On &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Most startups have huge ambitions – but little or no revenue. If you've spent years of your life in an exciting new project that never really took off, you already know how frustrating it can be. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School has been highly profitable for years.

In fact, we're one of the most successful online education companies of any kind. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To stay at the top, we need help with hiring the best people for our team. And that's why we're looking for a &lt;b&gt;Hiring Specialist&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; 7 Reasons To Join iPhone Photography &lt;br/&gt;School As A Hiring Specialist &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 1 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Develop A Highly Marketable Skill Set In Hiring &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you know how to hire people, you’ll never be out of work. That's because every company in the world needs help with hiring. It's that simple. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But most companies don't know how to hire well. We know this because we used to be one of those companies. We’ve made so many embarrassing hiring mistakes... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Thankfully, we've learned from our mistakes. It took us 5 years and tens of thousands of job applications… But now we have one of the most efficient hiring machines in the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you want to become a hiring expert, there’s no better place to do it than with us. &lt;/p&gt; 2 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Help Brilliant People Find Their Dream Jobs &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One of the things you love the most about hiring is the people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Meeting and getting to know job applicants from all walks of life is incredibly exciting. And helping them with something as important as finding a job is truly rewarding. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We’re always looking for brilliant people to join our team. And we can offer them something very few companies can. Many of our employees say they have found their dream jobs with us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll be helping brilliant people find their dream jobs. &lt;/p&gt; 3 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Take Our Company To The Next Level &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We've been the subject of dozens of magazine articles, TV news segments, online videos and awards. People are fascinated by our success so far. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But we're only getting started. We're about to take online education to a whole new level. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Currently, our team is just 19 people. To achieve our ambitious goals we’ll need to hire many more. And these hires will make or break the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That means your work will be critical to the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; 4 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stay In Control Of Your Schedule &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every job will occasionally have emergencies and important deadlines causing you to work long hours. That's normal. But it becomes a problem when long hours are the norm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That's not how we choose to work. We want (and even ask) our team members NOT to work long hours. That's because we're building our team for the long run. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join our team, and you’ll stay in charge of your schedule. &lt;/p&gt; 5 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stability You Can Count On &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Most startups have huge ambitions – but little or no revenue. If you've spent years of your life in an exciting new project that never really took off, you already know how frustrating it can be. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School has been highly profitable for years. We’ve never taken investor money. Our rapid growth has been funded by sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; You won’t have to worry about our company running out of money. &lt;/p&gt; 6 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Perks That Make A Difference &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To get the best results, we have to offer the best possible work conditions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Things like a top-of-the-line laptop, automated solutions for repetitive tasks, and investing in your education make your work more valuable. So providing them is a no-brainer for us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We also want you to have a sense of belonging to our team. Even if you work remotely, you'll get to meet your coworkers in person at our regular team retreats. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Whether it's rafting through the wilderness, sailing to a remote island, or participating in an ancient sauna ritual, you’ll remember these adventures for years to come. &lt;/p&gt; 7 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Join A Company You Truly Believe In &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Many people don't believe that their company creates a positive impact on the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But our company is different. We help millions of people take better photos. And we make the most beautiful online courses in the world (you can watch a sample video below). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every week we receive hundreds of heartfelt thank-you notes from our students saying we helped fill their lives with the joy of photography. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll work for a company you truly believe in. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; What Will You &lt;br/&gt; Do As A &lt;br/&gt; Hiring &lt;br/&gt; Specialist? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We get more than a thousand job applications each month. This number will continue to grow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Your job will be to review these applications and decide whether we want to continue the hiring process with each candidate. You’ll also interview the successful candidates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Over time, we'll be happy for you to take on more responsibilities in hiring. The more steps of the hiring process you can handle independently, the better it is for the company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Here’s What We Expect From You &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;li&gt; We can trust your decisions in the hiring process &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can carry out professional job interviews independently &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have the patience to go through hundreds of job applications per day &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can “sell” our company to job applicants &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have an eye for what makes a photograph or a video clip visually appealing (you’ll often have to evaluate applications for visual jobs such as video editor) &lt;/li&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is a full-time position. You can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our beautiful office in Riga, Latvia, or any paradise location. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you delay submitting your application, &lt;br/&gt; someone else will be hired before you. &lt;/p&gt;]]></content>

  <content><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; You’ve finally &lt;br/&gt;found it… &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The perfect job opportunity to skyrocket your career in hiring. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If that's what you've been looking for, &lt;b&gt;then this page could literally change your life!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But only if you keep reading. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; iPhone Photography School is the world's leading resource on iPhone photography. In fact, we're one of the most successful online education companies of any kind. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To stay at the top, we need help with hiring the best people for our team. And that's why we're looking for a &lt;b&gt;Hiring Specialist&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; 7 Reasons To Join iPhone Photography &lt;br/&gt;School As A Hiring Specialist &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 1 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Develop A Highly Marketable Skill Set In Hiring &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you know how to hire people, you’ll never be out of work. That's because every company in the world needs help with hiring. It's that simple. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But most companies don't know how to hire well. We know this because we used to be one of those companies. We’ve made so many embarrassing hiring mistakes... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Thankfully, we've learned from our mistakes. It took us 5 years and tens of thousands of job applications… But now we have one of the most efficient hiring machines in the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you want to become a hiring expert, there’s no better place to do it than with us. &lt;/p&gt; 2 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Help Brilliant People Find Their Dream Jobs &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One of the things you love the most about hiring is the people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Meeting and getting to know job applicants from all walks of life is incredibly exciting. And helping them with something as important as finding a job is truly rewarding. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We’re always looking for brilliant people to join our team. And we can offer them something very few companies can. Many of our employees say they have found their dream jobs with us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll be helping brilliant people find their dream jobs. &lt;/p&gt; 3 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Take Our Company To The Next Level &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We've been the subject of dozens of magazine articles, TV news segments, online videos and awards. People are fascinated by our success so far. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But we're only getting started. We're about to take online education to a whole new level. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Currently, our team is just 19 people. To achieve our ambitious goals we’ll need to hire many more. And these hires will make or break the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That means your work will be critical to the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; 4 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stay In Control Of Your Schedule &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every job will occasionally have emergencies and important deadlines causing you to work long hours. That's normal. But it becomes a problem when long hours are the norm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That's not how we choose to work. We want (and even ask) our team members NOT to work long hours. That's because we're building our team for the long run. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join our team, and you’ll stay in charge of your schedule. &lt;/p&gt; 5 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stability You Can Count On &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Most startups have huge ambitions – but little or no revenue. If you've spent years of your life in an exciting new project that never really took off, you already know how frustrating it can be. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School has been highly profitable for years. We’ve never taken investor money. Our rapid growth has been funded by sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; You won’t have to worry about our company running out of money. &lt;/p&gt; 6 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Perks That Make A Difference &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To get the best results, we have to offer the best possible work conditions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Things like a top-of-the-line laptop, automated solutions for repetitive tasks, and investing in your education make your work more valuable. So providing them is a no-brainer for us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We also want you to have a sense of belonging to our team. Even if you work remotely, you'll get to meet your coworkers in person at our regular team retreats. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Whether it's rafting through the wilderness, sailing to a remote island, or participating in an ancient sauna ritual, you’ll remember these adventures for years to come. &lt;/p&gt; 7 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Join A Company You Truly Believe In &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Many people don't believe that their company creates a positive impact on the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But our company is different. We help millions of people take better photos. And we make the most beautiful online courses in the world (you can watch a sample video below). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every week we receive hundreds of heartfelt thank-you notes from our students saying we helped fill their lives with the joy of photography. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll work for a company you truly believe in. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; What Will You &lt;br/&gt; Do As A &lt;br/&gt; Hiring &lt;br/&gt; Specialist? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We get more than a thousand job applications each month. This number will continue to grow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Your job will be to review these applications and decide whether we want to continue the hiring process with each candidate. You’ll also interview the successful candidates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Over time, we'll be happy for you to take on more responsibilities in hiring. The more steps of the hiring process you can handle independently, the better it is for the company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Here’s What We Expect From You &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;li&gt; We can trust your decisions in the hiring process &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can carry out professional job interviews independently &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have the patience to go through hundreds of job applications per day &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can “sell” our company to job applicants &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have an eye for what makes a photograph or a video clip visually appealing (you’ll often have to evaluate applications for visual jobs such as video editor) &lt;/li&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is a full-time position. You can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our beautiful office in Riga, Latvia, or any paradise location. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you delay submitting your application, &lt;br/&gt; someone else will be hired before you. &lt;/p&gt;]]></content>

  <content><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; You’ve finally &lt;br/&gt;found it… &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The perfect job opportunity to skyrocket your career in hiring. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If that's what you've been looking for, &lt;b&gt;then this page could literally change your life!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But only if you keep reading. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; iPhone Photography School is the world's leading resource on iPhone photography. In fact, we're one of the most successful online education companies of any kind. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To stay at the top, we need help with hiring the best people for our team. And that's why we're looking for a &lt;b&gt;Hiring Specialist&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; 7 Reasons To Join iPhone Photography &lt;br/&gt;School As A Hiring Specialist &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 1 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Develop A Highly Marketable Skill Set In Hiring &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you know how to hire people, you’ll never be out of work. That's because every company in the world needs help with hiring. It's that simple. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But most companies don't know how to hire well. We know this because we used to be one of those companies. We’ve made so many embarrassing hiring mistakes... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Thankfully, we've learned from our mistakes. It took us 5 years and tens of thousands of job applications… But now we have one of the most efficient hiring machines in the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you want to become a hiring expert, there’s no better place to do it than with us. &lt;/p&gt; 2 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Help Brilliant People Find Their Dream Jobs &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One of the things you love the most about hiring is the people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Meeting and getting to know job applicants from all walks of life is incredibly exciting. And helping them with something as important as finding a job is truly rewarding. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We’re always looking for brilliant people to join our team. And we can offer them something very few companies can. Many of our employees say they have found their dream jobs with us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll be helping brilliant people find their dream jobs. &lt;/p&gt; 3 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Take Our Company To The Next Level &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We've been the subject of dozens of magazine articles, TV news segments, online videos and awards. People are fascinated by our success so far. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But we're only getting started. We're about to take online education to a whole new level. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Currently, our team is just 19 people. To achieve our ambitious goals we’ll need to hire many more. And these hires will make or break the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That means your work will be critical to the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; 4 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stay In Control Of Your Schedule &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every job will occasionally have emergencies and important deadlines causing you to work long hours. That's normal. But it becomes a problem when long hours are the norm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That's not how we choose to work. We want (and even ask) our team members NOT to work long hours. That's because we're building our team for the long run. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join our team, and you’ll stay in charge of your schedule. &lt;/p&gt; 5 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stability You Can Count On &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Most startups have huge ambitions – but little or no revenue. If you've spent years of your life in an exciting new project that never really took off, you already know how frustrating it can be. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School has been highly profitable for years. We’ve never taken investor money. Our rapid growth has been funded by sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; You won’t have to worry about our company running out of money. &lt;/p&gt; 6 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Perks That Make A Difference &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To get the best results, we have to offer the best possible work conditions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Things like a top-of-the-line laptop, automated solutions for repetitive tasks, and investing in your education make your work more valuable. So providing them is a no-brainer for us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We also want you to have a sense of belonging to our team. Even if you work remotely, you'll get to meet your coworkers in person at our regular team retreats. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Whether it's rafting through the wilderness, sailing to a remote island, or participating in an ancient sauna ritual, you’ll remember these adventures for years to come. &lt;/p&gt; 7 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Join A Company You Truly Believe In &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Many people don't believe that their company creates a positive impact on the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But our company is different. We help millions of people take better photos. And we make the most beautiful online courses in the world (you can watch a sample video below). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every week we receive hundreds of heartfelt thank-you notes from our students saying we helped fill their lives with the joy of photography. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll work for a company you truly believe in. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; What Will You &lt;br/&gt; Do As A &lt;br/&gt; Hiring &lt;br/&gt; Specialist? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We get more than a thousand job applications each month. This number will continue to grow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Your job will be to review these applications and decide whether we want to continue the hiring process with each candidate. You’ll also interview the successful candidates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Over time, we'll be happy for you to take on more responsibilities in hiring. The more steps of the hiring process you can handle independently, the better it is for the company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Here’s What We Expect From You &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;li&gt; We can trust your decisions in the hiring process &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can carry out professional job interviews independently &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have the patience to go through hundreds of job applications per day &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can “sell” our company to job applicants &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have an eye for what makes a photograph or a video clip visually appealing (you’ll often have to evaluate applications for visual jobs such as video editor) &lt;/li&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is a full-time position. You can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our beautiful office in Riga, Latvia, or any paradise location. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you delay submitting your application, &lt;br/&gt; someone else will be hired before you. &lt;/p&gt;]]></content>

  <content><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; You’ve finally &lt;br/&gt;found it… &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The perfect job opportunity to skyrocket your career in hiring. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If that's what you've been looking for, &lt;b&gt;then this page could literally change your life!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But only if you keep reading. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; iPhone Photography School is the world's leading resource on iPhone photography. In fact, we're one of the most successful online education companies of any kind. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To stay at the top, we need help with hiring the best people for our team. And that's why we're looking for a &lt;b&gt;Hiring Specialist&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; 7 Reasons To Join iPhone Photography &lt;br/&gt;School As A Hiring Specialist &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 1 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Develop A Highly Marketable Skill Set In Hiring &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you know how to hire people, you’ll never be out of work. That's because every company in the world needs help with hiring. It's that simple. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But most companies don't know how to hire well. We know this because we used to be one of those companies. We’ve made so many embarrassing hiring mistakes... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Thankfully, we've learned from our mistakes. It took us 5 years and tens of thousands of job applications… But now we have one of the most efficient hiring machines in the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you want to become a hiring expert, there’s no better place to do it than with us. &lt;/p&gt; 2 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Help Brilliant People Find Their Dream Jobs &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One of the things you love the most about hiring is the people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Meeting and getting to know job applicants from all walks of life is incredibly exciting. And helping them with something as important as finding a job is truly rewarding. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We’re always looking for brilliant people to join our team. And we can offer them something very few companies can. Many of our employees say they have found their dream jobs with us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll be helping brilliant people find their dream jobs. &lt;/p&gt; 3 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Take Our Company To The Next Level &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We've been the subject of dozens of magazine articles, TV news segments, online videos and awards. People are fascinated by our success so far. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But we're only getting started. We're about to take online education to a whole new level. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Currently, our team is just 19 people. To achieve our ambitious goals we’ll need to hire many more. And these hires will make or break the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That means your work will be critical to the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; 4 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stay In Control Of Your Schedule &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every job will occasionally have emergencies and important deadlines causing you to work long hours. That's normal. But it becomes a problem when long hours are the norm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That's not how we choose to work. We want (and even ask) our team members NOT to work long hours. That's because we're building our team for the long run. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join our team, and you’ll stay in charge of your schedule. &lt;/p&gt; 5 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stability You Can Count On &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Most startups have huge ambitions – but little or no revenue. If you've spent years of your life in an exciting new project that never really took off, you already know how frustrating it can be. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School has been highly profitable for years. We’ve never taken investor money. Our rapid growth has been funded by sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; You won’t have to worry about our company running out of money. &lt;/p&gt; 6 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Perks That Make A Difference &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To get the best results, we have to offer the best possible work conditions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Things like a top-of-the-line laptop, automated solutions for repetitive tasks, and investing in your education make your work more valuable. So providing them is a no-brainer for us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We also want you to have a sense of belonging to our team. Even if you work remotely, you'll get to meet your coworkers in person at our regular team retreats. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Whether it's rafting through the wilderness, sailing to a remote island, or participating in an ancient sauna ritual, you’ll remember these adventures for years to come. &lt;/p&gt; 7 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Join A Company You Truly Believe In &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Many people don't believe that their company creates a positive impact on the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But our company is different. We help millions of people take better photos. And we make the most beautiful online courses in the world (you can watch a sample video below). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every week we receive hundreds of heartfelt thank-you notes from our students saying we helped fill their lives with the joy of photography. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll work for a company you truly believe in. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; What Will You &lt;br/&gt; Do As A &lt;br/&gt; Hiring &lt;br/&gt; Specialist? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We get more than a thousand job applications each month. This number will continue to grow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Your job will be to review these applications and decide whether we want to continue the hiring process with each candidate. You’ll also interview the successful candidates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Over time, we'll be happy for you to take on more responsibilities in hiring. The more steps of the hiring process you can handle independently, the better it is for the company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Here’s What We Expect From You &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;li&gt; We can trust your decisions in the hiring process &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can carry out professional job interviews independently &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have the patience to go through hundreds of job applications per day &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can “sell” our company to job applicants &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have an eye for what makes a photograph or a video clip visually appealing (you’ll often have to evaluate applications for visual jobs such as video editor) &lt;/li&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is a full-time position. You can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our beautiful office in Riga, Latvia, or any paradise location. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you delay submitting your application, &lt;br/&gt; someone else will be hired before you. &lt;/p&gt;]]></content>

In fact, we're one of the most successful online education companies of any kind. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To stay at the top, we need help with hiring the best people for our team. And that's why we're looking for a &lt;b&gt;Hiring Specialist&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; 7 Reasons To Join iPhone Photography &lt;br/&gt;School As A Hiring Specialist &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 1 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Develop A Highly Marketable Skill Set In Hiring &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you know how to hire people, you’ll never be out of work. That's because every company in the world needs help with hiring. It's that simple. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But most companies don't know how to hire well. We know this because we used to be one of those companies. We’ve made so many embarrassing hiring mistakes... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Thankfully, we've learned from our mistakes. It took us 5 years and tens of thousands of job applications… But now we have one of the most efficient hiring machines in the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you want to become a hiring expert, there’s no better place to do it than with us. &lt;/p&gt; 2 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Help Brilliant People Find Their Dream Jobs &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One of the things you love the most about hiring is the people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Meeting and getting to know job applicants from all walks of life is incredibly exciting. And helping them with something as important as finding a job is truly rewarding. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We’re always looking for brilliant people to join our team. And we can offer them something very few companies can. Many of our employees say they have found their dream jobs with us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll be helping brilliant people find their dream jobs. &lt;/p&gt; 3 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Take Our Company To The Next Level &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We've been the subject of dozens of magazine articles, TV news segments, online videos and awards. People are fascinated by our success so far. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But we're only getting started. We're about to take online education to a whole new level. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Currently, our team is just 19 people. To achieve our ambitious goals we’ll need to hire many more. And these hires will make or break the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That means your work will be critical to the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; 4 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stay In Control Of Your Schedule &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every job will occasionally have emergencies and important deadlines causing you to work long hours. That's normal. But it becomes a problem when long hours are the norm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That's not how we choose to work. We want (and even ask) our team members NOT to work long hours. That's because we're building our team for the long run. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join our team, and you’ll stay in charge of your schedule. &lt;/p&gt; 5 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stability You Can Count On &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Most startups have huge ambitions – but little or no revenue. If you've spent years of your life in an exciting new project that never really took off, you already know how frustrating it can be. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School has been highly profitable for years. We’ve never taken investor money. Our rapid growth has been funded by sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; You won’t have to worry about our company running out of money. &lt;/p&gt; 6 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Perks That Make A Difference &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To get the best results, we have to offer the best possible work conditions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Things like a top-of-the-line laptop, automated solutions for repetitive tasks, and investing in your education make your work more valuable. So providing them is a no-brainer for us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We also want you to have a sense of belonging to our team. Even if you work remotely, you'll get to meet your coworkers in person at our regular team retreats. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Whether it's rafting through the wilderness, sailing to a remote island, or participating in an ancient sauna ritual, you’ll remember these adventures for years to come. &lt;/p&gt; 7 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Join A Company You Truly Believe In &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Many people don't believe that their company creates a positive impact on the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But our company is different. We help millions of people take better photos. And we make the most beautiful online courses in the world (you can watch a sample video below). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every week we receive hundreds of heartfelt thank-you notes from our students saying we helped fill their lives with the joy of photography. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll work for a company you truly believe in. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; What Will You &lt;br/&gt; Do As A &lt;br/&gt; Hiring &lt;br/&gt; Specialist? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We get more than a thousand job applications each month. This number will continue to grow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Your job will be to review these applications and decide whether we want to continue the hiring process with each candidate. You’ll also interview the successful candidates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Over time, we'll be happy for you to take on more responsibilities in hiring. The more steps of the hiring process you can handle independently, the better it is for the company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Here’s What We Expect From You &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;li&gt; We can trust your decisions in the hiring process &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can carry out professional job interviews independently &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have the patience to go through hundreds of job applications per day &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can “sell” our company to job applicants &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have an eye for what makes a photograph or a video clip visually appealing (you’ll often have to evaluate applications for visual jobs such as video editor) &lt;/li&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is a full-time position. You can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our beautiful office in Riga, Latvia, or any paradise location. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you delay submitting your application, &lt;br/&gt; someone else will be hired before you. &lt;/p&gt;]]></content>

In fact, we're one of the most successful online education companies of any kind. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To stay at the top, we need help with hiring the best people for our team. And that's why we're looking for a &lt;b&gt;Hiring Specialist&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; 7 Reasons To Join iPhone Photography &lt;br/&gt;School As A Hiring Specialist &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 1 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Develop A Highly Marketable Skill Set In Hiring &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you know how to hire people, you’ll never be out of work. That's because every company in the world needs help with hiring. It's that simple. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But most companies don't know how to hire well. We know this because we used to be one of those companies. We’ve made so many embarrassing hiring mistakes... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Thankfully, we've learned from our mistakes. It took us 5 years and tens of thousands of job applications… But now we have one of the most efficient hiring machines in the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you want to become a hiring expert, there’s no better place to do it than with us. &lt;/p&gt; 2 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Help Brilliant People Find Their Dream Jobs &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One of the things you love the most about hiring is the people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Meeting and getting to know job applicants from all walks of life is incredibly exciting. And helping them with something as important as finding a job is truly rewarding. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We’re always looking for brilliant people to join our team. And we can offer them something very few companies can. Many of our employees say they have found their dream jobs with us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll be helping brilliant people find their dream jobs. &lt;/p&gt; 3 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Take Our Company To The Next Level &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We've been the subject of dozens of magazine articles, TV news segments, online videos and awards. People are fascinated by our success so far. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But we're only getting started. We're about to take online education to a whole new level. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Currently, our team is just 19 people. To achieve our ambitious goals we’ll need to hire many more. And these hires will make or break the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That means your work will be critical to the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; 4 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stay In Control Of Your Schedule &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every job will occasionally have emergencies and important deadlines causing you to work long hours. That's normal. But it becomes a problem when long hours are the norm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That's not how we choose to work. We want (and even ask) our team members NOT to work long hours. That's because we're building our team for the long run. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join our team, and you’ll stay in charge of your schedule. &lt;/p&gt; 5 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stability You Can Count On &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Most startups have huge ambitions – but little or no revenue. If you've spent years of your life in an exciting new project that never really took off, you already know how frustrating it can be. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School has been highly profitable for years. We’ve never taken investor money. Our rapid growth has been funded by sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; You won’t have to worry about our company running out of money. &lt;/p&gt; 6 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Perks That Make A Difference &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To get the best results, we have to offer the best possible work conditions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Things like a top-of-the-line laptop, automated solutions for repetitive tasks, and investing in your education make your work more valuable. So providing them is a no-brainer for us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We also want you to have a sense of belonging to our team. Even if you work remotely, you'll get to meet your coworkers in person at our regular team retreats. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Whether it's rafting through the wilderness, sailing to a remote island, or participating in an ancient sauna ritual, you’ll remember these adventures for years to come. &lt;/p&gt; 7 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Join A Company You Truly Believe In &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Many people don't believe that their company creates a positive impact on the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But our company is different. We help millions of people take better photos. And we make the most beautiful online courses in the world (you can watch a sample video below). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every week we receive hundreds of heartfelt thank-you notes from our students saying we helped fill their lives with the joy of photography. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll work for a company you truly believe in. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; What Will You &lt;br/&gt; Do As A &lt;br/&gt; Hiring &lt;br/&gt; Specialist? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We get more than a thousand job applications each month. This number will continue to grow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Your job will be to review these applications and decide whether we want to continue the hiring process with each candidate. You’ll also interview the successful candidates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Over time, we'll be happy for you to take on more responsibilities in hiring. The more steps of the hiring process you can handle independently, the better it is for the company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Here’s What We Expect From You &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;li&gt; We can trust your decisions in the hiring process &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can carry out professional job interviews independently &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have the patience to go through hundreds of job applications per day &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can “sell” our company to job applicants &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have an eye for what makes a photograph or a video clip visually appealing (you’ll often have to evaluate applications for visual jobs such as video editor) &lt;/li&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is a full-time position. You can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our beautiful office in Riga, Latvia, or any paradise location. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you delay submitting your application, &lt;br/&gt; someone else will be hired before you. &lt;/p&gt;]]></content>

  <content><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; You’ve finally &lt;br/&gt;found it… &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The perfect job opportunity to skyrocket your career in hiring. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If that's what you've been looking for, &lt;b&gt;then this page could literally change your life!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But only if you keep reading. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; iPhone Photography School is the world's leading resource on iPhone photography. In fact, we're one of the most successful online education companies of any kind. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To stay at the top, we need help with hiring the best people for our team. And that's why we're looking for a &lt;b&gt;Hiring Specialist&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; 7 Reasons To Join iPhone Photography &lt;br/&gt;School As A Hiring Specialist &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 1 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Develop A Highly Marketable Skill Set In Hiring &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you know how to hire people, you’ll never be out of work. That's because every company in the world needs help with hiring. It's that simple. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But most companies don't know how to hire well. We know this because we used to be one of those companies. We’ve made so many embarrassing hiring mistakes... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Thankfully, we've learned from our mistakes. It took us 5 years and tens of thousands of job applications… But now we have one of the most efficient hiring machines in the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you want to become a hiring expert, there’s no better place to do it than with us. &lt;/p&gt; 2 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Help Brilliant People Find Their Dream Jobs &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One of the things you love the most about hiring is the people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Meeting and getting to know job applicants from all walks of life is incredibly exciting. And helping them with something as important as finding a job is truly rewarding. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We’re always looking for brilliant people to join our team. And we can offer them something very few companies can. Many of our employees say they have found their dream jobs with us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll be helping brilliant people find their dream jobs. &lt;/p&gt; 3 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Take Our Company To The Next Level &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We've been the subject of dozens of magazine articles, TV news segments, online videos and awards. People are fascinated by our success so far. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But we're only getting started. We're about to take online education to a whole new level. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Currently, our team is just 19 people. To achieve our ambitious goals we’ll need to hire many more. And these hires will make or break the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That means your work will be critical to the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; 4 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stay In Control Of Your Schedule &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every job will occasionally have emergencies and important deadlines causing you to work long hours. That's normal. But it becomes a problem when long hours are the norm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That's not how we choose to work. We want (and even ask) our team members NOT to work long hours. That's because we're building our team for the long run. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join our team, and you’ll stay in charge of your schedule. &lt;/p&gt; 5 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stability You Can Count On &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Most startups have huge ambitions – but little or no revenue. If you've spent years of your life in an exciting new project that never really took off, you already know how frustrating it can be. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School has been highly profitable for years. We’ve never taken investor money. Our rapid growth has been funded by sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; You won’t have to worry about our company running out of money. &lt;/p&gt; 6 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Perks That Make A Difference &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To get the best results, we have to offer the best possible work conditions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Things like a top-of-the-line laptop, automated solutions for repetitive tasks, and investing in your education make your work more valuable. So providing them is a no-brainer for us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We also want you to have a sense of belonging to our team. Even if you work remotely, you'll get to meet your coworkers in person at our regular team retreats. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Whether it's rafting through the wilderness, sailing to a remote island, or participating in an ancient sauna ritual, you’ll remember these adventures for years to come. &lt;/p&gt; 7 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Join A Company You Truly Believe In &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Many people don't believe that their company creates a positive impact on the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But our company is different. We help millions of people take better photos. And we make the most beautiful online courses in the world (you can watch a sample video below). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every week we receive hundreds of heartfelt thank-you notes from our students saying we helped fill their lives with the joy of photography. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll work for a company you truly believe in. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; What Will You &lt;br/&gt; Do As A &lt;br/&gt; Hiring &lt;br/&gt; Specialist? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We get more than a thousand job applications each month. This number will continue to grow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Your job will be to review these applications and decide whether we want to continue the hiring process with each candidate. You’ll also interview the successful candidates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Over time, we'll be happy for you to take on more responsibilities in hiring. The more steps of the hiring process you can handle independently, the better it is for the company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Here’s What We Expect From You &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;li&gt; We can trust your decisions in the hiring process &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can carry out professional job interviews independently &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have the patience to go through hundreds of job applications per day &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can “sell” our company to job applicants &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have an eye for what makes a photograph or a video clip visually appealing (you’ll often have to evaluate applications for visual jobs such as video editor) &lt;/li&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is a full-time position. You can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our beautiful office in Riga, Latvia, or any paradise location. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you delay submitting your application, &lt;br/&gt; someone else will be hired before you. &lt;/p&gt;]]></content>

In fact, we're one of the most successful online education companies of any kind. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To stay at the top, we need help with hiring the best people for our team. And that's why we're looking for a &lt;b&gt;Hiring Specialist&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; 7 Reasons To Join iPhone Photography &lt;br/&gt;School As A Hiring Specialist &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 1 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Develop A Highly Marketable Skill Set In Hiring &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you know how to hire people, you’ll never be out of work. That's because every company in the world needs help with hiring. It's that simple. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But most companies don't know how to hire well. We know this because we used to be one of those companies. We’ve made so many embarrassing hiring mistakes... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Thankfully, we've learned from our mistakes. It took us 5 years and tens of thousands of job applications… But now we have one of the most efficient hiring machines in the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you want to become a hiring expert, there’s no better place to do it than with us. &lt;/p&gt; 2 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Help Brilliant People Find Their Dream Jobs &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One of the things you love the most about hiring is the people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Meeting and getting to know job applicants from all walks of life is incredibly exciting. And helping them with something as important as finding a job is truly rewarding. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We’re always looking for brilliant people to join our team. And we can offer them something very few companies can. Many of our employees say they have found their dream jobs with us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll be helping brilliant people find their dream jobs. &lt;/p&gt; 3 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Take Our Company To The Next Level &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We've been the subject of dozens of magazine articles, TV news segments, online videos and awards. People are fascinated by our success so far. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But we're only getting started. We're about to take online education to a whole new level. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Currently, our team is just 19 people. To achieve our ambitious goals we’ll need to hire many more. And these hires will make or break the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That means your work will be critical to the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; 4 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stay In Control Of Your Schedule &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every job will occasionally have emergencies and important deadlines causing you to work long hours. That's normal. But it becomes a problem when long hours are the norm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That's not how we choose to work. We want (and even ask) our team members NOT to work long hours. That's because we're building our team for the long run. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join our team, and you’ll stay in charge of your schedule. &lt;/p&gt; 5 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stability You Can Count On &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Most startups have huge ambitions – but little or no revenue. If you've spent years of your life in an exciting new project that never really took off, you already know how frustrating it can be. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School has been highly profitable for years. We’ve never taken investor money. Our rapid growth has been funded by sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; You won’t have to worry about our company running out of money. &lt;/p&gt; 6 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Perks That Make A Difference &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To get the best results, we have to offer the best possible work conditions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Things like a top-of-the-line laptop, automated solutions for repetitive tasks, and investing in your education make your work more valuable. So providing them is a no-brainer for us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We also want you to have a sense of belonging to our team. Even if you work remotely, you'll get to meet your coworkers in person at our regular team retreats. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Whether it's rafting through the wilderness, sailing to a remote island, or participating in an ancient sauna ritual, you’ll remember these adventures for years to come. &lt;/p&gt; 7 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Join A Company You Truly Believe In &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Many people don't believe that their company creates a positive impact on the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But our company is different. We help millions of people take better photos. And we make the most beautiful online courses in the world (you can watch a sample video below). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every week we receive hundreds of heartfelt thank-you notes from our students saying we helped fill their lives with the joy of photography. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll work for a company you truly believe in. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; What Will You &lt;br/&gt; Do As A &lt;br/&gt; Hiring &lt;br/&gt; Specialist? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We get more than a thousand job applications each month. This number will continue to grow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Your job will be to review these applications and decide whether we want to continue the hiring process with each candidate. You’ll also interview the successful candidates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Over time, we'll be happy for you to take on more responsibilities in hiring. The more steps of the hiring process you can handle independently, the better it is for the company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Here’s What We Expect From You &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;li&gt; We can trust your decisions in the hiring process &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can carry out professional job interviews independently &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have the patience to go through hundreds of job applications per day &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can “sell” our company to job applicants &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have an eye for what makes a photograph or a video clip visually appealing (you’ll often have to evaluate applications for visual jobs such as video editor) &lt;/li&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is a full-time position. You can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our beautiful office in Riga, Latvia, or any paradise location. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you delay submitting your application, &lt;br/&gt; someone else will be hired before you. &lt;/p&gt;]]></content>

And we make the most beautiful online courses in the world (you can watch a sample video below). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every week we receive hundreds of heartfelt thank-you notes from our students saying we helped fill their lives with the joy of photography. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll work for a company you truly believe in. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; What Will You &lt;br/&gt; Do As A &lt;br/&gt; Hiring &lt;br/&gt; Specialist? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We get more than a thousand job applications each month. This number will continue to grow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Your job will be to review these applications and decide whether we want to continue the hiring process with each candidate. You’ll also interview the successful candidates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Over time, we'll be happy for you to take on more responsibilities in hiring. The more steps of the hiring process you can handle independently, the better it is for the company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Here’s What We Expect From You &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;li&gt; We can trust your decisions in the hiring process &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can carry out professional job interviews independently &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have the patience to go through hundreds of job applications per day &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can “sell” our company to job applicants &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have an eye for what makes a photograph or a video clip visually appealing (you’ll often have to evaluate applications for visual jobs such as video editor) &lt;/li&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is a full-time position. You can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our beautiful office in Riga, Latvia, or any paradise location. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you delay submitting your application, &lt;br/&gt; someone else will be hired before you. &lt;/p&gt;]]></content>

In fact, we're one of the most successful online education companies of any kind. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To stay at the top, we need help with hiring the best people for our team. And that's why we're looking for a &lt;b&gt;Hiring Specialist&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; 7 Reasons To Join iPhone Photography &lt;br/&gt;School As A Hiring Specialist &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 1 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Develop A Highly Marketable Skill Set In Hiring &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you know how to hire people, you’ll never be out of work. That's because every company in the world needs help with hiring. It's that simple. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But most companies don't know how to hire well. We know this because we used to be one of those companies. We’ve made so many embarrassing hiring mistakes... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Thankfully, we've learned from our mistakes. It took us 5 years and tens of thousands of job applications… But now we have one of the most efficient hiring machines in the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you want to become a hiring expert, there’s no better place to do it than with us. &lt;/p&gt; 2 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Help Brilliant People Find Their Dream Jobs &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One of the things you love the most about hiring is the people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Meeting and getting to know job applicants from all walks of life is incredibly exciting. And helping them with something as important as finding a job is truly rewarding. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We’re always looking for brilliant people to join our team. And we can offer them something very few companies can. Many of our employees say they have found their dream jobs with us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll be helping brilliant people find their dream jobs. &lt;/p&gt; 3 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Take Our Company To The Next Level &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We've been the subject of dozens of magazine articles, TV news segments, online videos and awards. People are fascinated by our success so far. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But we're only getting started. We're about to take online education to a whole new level. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Currently, our team is just 19 people. To achieve our ambitious goals we’ll need to hire many more. And these hires will make or break the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That means your work will be critical to the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; 4 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stay In Control Of Your Schedule &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every job will occasionally have emergencies and important deadlines causing you to work long hours. That's normal. But it becomes a problem when long hours are the norm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That's not how we choose to work. We want (and even ask) our team members NOT to work long hours. That's because we're building our team for the long run. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join our team, and you’ll stay in charge of your schedule. &lt;/p&gt; 5 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stability You Can Count On &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Most startups have huge ambitions – but little or no revenue. If you've spent years of your life in an exciting new project that never really took off, you already know how frustrating it can be. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School has been highly profitable for years. We’ve never taken investor money. Our rapid growth has been funded by sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; You won’t have to worry about our company running out of money. &lt;/p&gt; 6 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Perks That Make A Difference &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To get the best results, we have to offer the best possible work conditions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Things like a top-of-the-line laptop, automated solutions for repetitive tasks, and investing in your education make your work more valuable. So providing them is a no-brainer for us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We also want you to have a sense of belonging to our team. Even if you work remotely, you'll get to meet your coworkers in person at our regular team retreats. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Whether it's rafting through the wilderness, sailing to a remote island, or participating in an ancient sauna ritual, you’ll remember these adventures for years to come. &lt;/p&gt; 7 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Join A Company You Truly Believe In &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Many people don't believe that their company creates a positive impact on the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But our company is different. We help millions of people take better photos. And we make the most beautiful online courses in the world (you can watch a sample video below). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every week we receive hundreds of heartfelt thank-you notes from our students saying we helped fill their lives with the joy of photography. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll work for a company you truly believe in. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; What Will You &lt;br/&gt; Do As A &lt;br/&gt; Hiring &lt;br/&gt; Specialist? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We get more than a thousand job applications each month. This number will continue to grow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Your job will be to review these applications and decide whether we want to continue the hiring process with each candidate. You’ll also interview the successful candidates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Over time, we'll be happy for you to take on more responsibilities in hiring. The more steps of the hiring process you can handle independently, the better it is for the company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Here’s What We Expect From You &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;li&gt; We can trust your decisions in the hiring process &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can carry out professional job interviews independently &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have the patience to go through hundreds of job applications per day &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can “sell” our company to job applicants &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have an eye for what makes a photograph or a video clip visually appealing (you’ll often have to evaluate applications for visual jobs such as video editor) &lt;/li&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is a full-time position. You can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our beautiful office in Riga, Latvia, or any paradise location. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you delay submitting your application, &lt;br/&gt; someone else will be hired before you. &lt;/p&gt;]]></content>

And that's why we're looking for a &lt;b&gt;Hiring Specialist&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; 7 Reasons To Join iPhone Photography &lt;br/&gt;School As A Hiring Specialist &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 1 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Develop A Highly Marketable Skill Set In Hiring &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you know how to hire people, you’ll never be out of work. That's because every company in the world needs help with hiring. It's that simple. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But most companies don't know how to hire well. We know this because we used to be one of those companies. We’ve made so many embarrassing hiring mistakes... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Thankfully, we've learned from our mistakes. It took us 5 years and tens of thousands of job applications… But now we have one of the most efficient hiring machines in the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you want to become a hiring expert, there’s no better place to do it than with us. &lt;/p&gt; 2 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Help Brilliant People Find Their Dream Jobs &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One of the things you love the most about hiring is the people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Meeting and getting to know job applicants from all walks of life is incredibly exciting. And helping them with something as important as finding a job is truly rewarding. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We’re always looking for brilliant people to join our team. And we can offer them something very few companies can. Many of our employees say they have found their dream jobs with us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll be helping brilliant people find their dream jobs. &lt;/p&gt; 3 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Take Our Company To The Next Level &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We've been the subject of dozens of magazine articles, TV news segments, online videos and awards. People are fascinated by our success so far. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But we're only getting started. We're about to take online education to a whole new level. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Currently, our team is just 19 people. To achieve our ambitious goals we’ll need to hire many more. And these hires will make or break the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That means your work will be critical to the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; 4 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stay In Control Of Your Schedule &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every job will occasionally have emergencies and important deadlines causing you to work long hours. That's normal. But it becomes a problem when long hours are the norm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That's not how we choose to work. We want (and even ask) our team members NOT to work long hours. That's because we're building our team for the long run. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join our team, and you’ll stay in charge of your schedule. &lt;/p&gt; 5 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stability You Can Count On &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Most startups have huge ambitions – but little or no revenue. If you've spent years of your life in an exciting new project that never really took off, you already know how frustrating it can be. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School has been highly profitable for years. We’ve never taken investor money. Our rapid growth has been funded by sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; You won’t have to worry about our company running out of money. &lt;/p&gt; 6 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Perks That Make A Difference &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To get the best results, we have to offer the best possible work conditions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Things like a top-of-the-line laptop, automated solutions for repetitive tasks, and investing in your education make your work more valuable. So providing them is a no-brainer for us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We also want you to have a sense of belonging to our team. Even if you work remotely, you'll get to meet your coworkers in person at our regular team retreats. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Whether it's rafting through the wilderness, sailing to a remote island, or participating in an ancient sauna ritual, you’ll remember these adventures for years to come. &lt;/p&gt; 7 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Join A Company You Truly Believe In &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Many people don't believe that their company creates a positive impact on the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But our company is different. We help millions of people take better photos. And we make the most beautiful online courses in the world (you can watch a sample video below). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every week we receive hundreds of heartfelt thank-you notes from our students saying we helped fill their lives with the joy of photography. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll work for a company you truly believe in. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; What Will You &lt;br/&gt; Do As A &lt;br/&gt; Hiring &lt;br/&gt; Specialist? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We get more than a thousand job applications each month. This number will continue to grow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Your job will be to review these applications and decide whether we want to continue the hiring process with each candidate. You’ll also interview the successful candidates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Over time, we'll be happy for you to take on more responsibilities in hiring. The more steps of the hiring process you can handle independently, the better it is for the company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Here’s What We Expect From You &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;li&gt; We can trust your decisions in the hiring process &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can carry out professional job interviews independently &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have the patience to go through hundreds of job applications per day &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can “sell” our company to job applicants &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have an eye for what makes a photograph or a video clip visually appealing (you’ll often have to evaluate applications for visual jobs such as video editor) &lt;/li&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is a full-time position. You can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our beautiful office in Riga, Latvia, or any paradise location. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you delay submitting your application, &lt;br/&gt; someone else will be hired before you. &lt;/p&gt;]]></content>

In fact, we're one of the most successful online education companies of any kind. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To stay at the top, we need help with hiring the best people for our team. And that's why we're looking for a &lt;b&gt;Hiring Specialist&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; 7 Reasons To Join iPhone Photography &lt;br/&gt;School As A Hiring Specialist &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 1 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Develop A Highly Marketable Skill Set In Hiring &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you know how to hire people, you’ll never be out of work. That's because every company in the world needs help with hiring. It's that simple. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But most companies don't know how to hire well. We know this because we used to be one of those companies. We’ve made so many embarrassing hiring mistakes... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Thankfully, we've learned from our mistakes. It took us 5 years and tens of thousands of job applications… But now we have one of the most efficient hiring machines in the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you want to become a hiring expert, there’s no better place to do it than with us. &lt;/p&gt; 2 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Help Brilliant People Find Their Dream Jobs &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One of the things you love the most about hiring is the people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Meeting and getting to know job applicants from all walks of life is incredibly exciting. And helping them with something as important as finding a job is truly rewarding. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We’re always looking for brilliant people to join our team. And we can offer them something very few companies can. Many of our employees say they have found their dream jobs with us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll be helping brilliant people find their dream jobs. &lt;/p&gt; 3 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Take Our Company To The Next Level &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We've been the subject of dozens of magazine articles, TV news segments, online videos and awards. People are fascinated by our success so far. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But we're only getting started. We're about to take online education to a whole new level. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Currently, our team is just 19 people. To achieve our ambitious goals we’ll need to hire many more. And these hires will make or break the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That means your work will be critical to the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; 4 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stay In Control Of Your Schedule &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every job will occasionally have emergencies and important deadlines causing you to work long hours. That's normal. But it becomes a problem when long hours are the norm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That's not how we choose to work. We want (and even ask) our team members NOT to work long hours. That's because we're building our team for the long run. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join our team, and you’ll stay in charge of your schedule. &lt;/p&gt; 5 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stability You Can Count On &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Most startups have huge ambitions – but little or no revenue. If you've spent years of your life in an exciting new project that never really took off, you already know how frustrating it can be. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School has been highly profitable for years. We’ve never taken investor money. Our rapid growth has been funded by sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; You won’t have to worry about our company running out of money. &lt;/p&gt; 6 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Perks That Make A Difference &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To get the best results, we have to offer the best possible work conditions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Things like a top-of-the-line laptop, automated solutions for repetitive tasks, and investing in your education make your work more valuable. So providing them is a no-brainer for us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We also want you to have a sense of belonging to our team. Even if you work remotely, you'll get to meet your coworkers in person at our regular team retreats. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Whether it's rafting through the wilderness, sailing to a remote island, or participating in an ancient sauna ritual, you’ll remember these adventures for years to come. &lt;/p&gt; 7 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Join A Company You Truly Believe In &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Many people don't believe that their company creates a positive impact on the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But our company is different. We help millions of people take better photos. And we make the most beautiful online courses in the world (you can watch a sample video below). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every week we receive hundreds of heartfelt thank-you notes from our students saying we helped fill their lives with the joy of photography. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll work for a company you truly believe in. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; What Will You &lt;br/&gt; Do As A &lt;br/&gt; Hiring &lt;br/&gt; Specialist? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We get more than a thousand job applications each month. This number will continue to grow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Your job will be to review these applications and decide whether we want to continue the hiring process with each candidate. You’ll also interview the successful candidates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Over time, we'll be happy for you to take on more responsibilities in hiring. The more steps of the hiring process you can handle independently, the better it is for the company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Here’s What We Expect From You &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;li&gt; We can trust your decisions in the hiring process &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can carry out professional job interviews independently &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have the patience to go through hundreds of job applications per day &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can “sell” our company to job applicants &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have an eye for what makes a photograph or a video clip visually appealing (you’ll often have to evaluate applications for visual jobs such as video editor) &lt;/li&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is a full-time position. You can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our beautiful office in Riga, Latvia, or any paradise location. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you delay submitting your application, &lt;br/&gt; someone else will be hired before you. &lt;/p&gt;]]></content>

In fact, we're one of the most successful online education companies of any kind. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To stay at the top, we need help with hiring the best people for our team. And that's why we're looking for a &lt;b&gt;Hiring Specialist&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; 7 Reasons To Join iPhone Photography &lt;br/&gt;School As A Hiring Specialist &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 1 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Develop A Highly Marketable Skill Set In Hiring &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you know how to hire people, you’ll never be out of work. That's because every company in the world needs help with hiring. It's that simple. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But most companies don't know how to hire well. We know this because we used to be one of those companies. We’ve made so many embarrassing hiring mistakes... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Thankfully, we've learned from our mistakes. It took us 5 years and tens of thousands of job applications… But now we have one of the most efficient hiring machines in the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you want to become a hiring expert, there’s no better place to do it than with us. &lt;/p&gt; 2 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Help Brilliant People Find Their Dream Jobs &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One of the things you love the most about hiring is the people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Meeting and getting to know job applicants from all walks of life is incredibly exciting. And helping them with something as important as finding a job is truly rewarding. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We’re always looking for brilliant people to join our team. And we can offer them something very few companies can. Many of our employees say they have found their dream jobs with us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll be helping brilliant people find their dream jobs. &lt;/p&gt; 3 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Take Our Company To The Next Level &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We've been the subject of dozens of magazine articles, TV news segments, online videos and awards. People are fascinated by our success so far. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But we're only getting started. We're about to take online education to a whole new level. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Currently, our team is just 19 people. To achieve our ambitious goals we’ll need to hire many more. And these hires will make or break the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That means your work will be critical to the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; 4 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stay In Control Of Your Schedule &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every job will occasionally have emergencies and important deadlines causing you to work long hours. That's normal. But it becomes a problem when long hours are the norm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That's not how we choose to work. We want (and even ask) our team members NOT to work long hours. That's because we're building our team for the long run. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join our team, and you’ll stay in charge of your schedule. &lt;/p&gt; 5 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stability You Can Count On &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Most startups have huge ambitions – but little or no revenue. If you've spent years of your life in an exciting new project that never really took off, you already know how frustrating it can be. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School has been highly profitable for years. We’ve never taken investor money. Our rapid growth has been funded by sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; You won’t have to worry about our company running out of money. &lt;/p&gt; 6 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Perks That Make A Difference &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To get the best results, we have to offer the best possible work conditions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Things like a top-of-the-line laptop, automated solutions for repetitive tasks, and investing in your education make your work more valuable. So providing them is a no-brainer for us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We also want you to have a sense of belonging to our team. Even if you work remotely, you'll get to meet your coworkers in person at our regular team retreats. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Whether it's rafting through the wilderness, sailing to a remote island, or participating in an ancient sauna ritual, you’ll remember these adventures for years to come. &lt;/p&gt; 7 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Join A Company You Truly Believe In &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Many people don't believe that their company creates a positive impact on the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But our company is different. We help millions of people take better photos. And we make the most beautiful online courses in the world (you can watch a sample video below). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every week we receive hundreds of heartfelt thank-you notes from our students saying we helped fill their lives with the joy of photography. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll work for a company you truly believe in. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; What Will You &lt;br/&gt; Do As A &lt;br/&gt; Hiring &lt;br/&gt; Specialist? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We get more than a thousand job applications each month. This number will continue to grow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Your job will be to review these applications and decide whether we want to continue the hiring process with each candidate. You’ll also interview the successful candidates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Over time, we'll be happy for you to take on more responsibilities in hiring. The more steps of the hiring process you can handle independently, the better it is for the company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Here’s What We Expect From You &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;li&gt; We can trust your decisions in the hiring process &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can carry out professional job interviews independently &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have the patience to go through hundreds of job applications per day &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can “sell” our company to job applicants &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have an eye for what makes a photograph or a video clip visually appealing (you’ll often have to evaluate applications for visual jobs such as video editor) &lt;/li&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is a full-time position. You can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our beautiful office in Riga, Latvia, or any paradise location. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you delay submitting your application, &lt;br/&gt; someone else will be hired before you. &lt;/p&gt;]]></content>

People are fascinated by our success so far. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But we're only getting started. We're about to take online education to a whole new level. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Currently, our team is just 19 people. To achieve our ambitious goals we’ll need to hire many more. And these hires will make or break the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That means your work will be critical to the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; 4 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stay In Control Of Your Schedule &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every job will occasionally have emergencies and important deadlines causing you to work long hours. That's normal. But it becomes a problem when long hours are the norm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That's not how we choose to work. We want (and even ask) our team members NOT to work long hours. That's because we're building our team for the long run. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join our team, and you’ll stay in charge of your schedule. &lt;/p&gt; 5 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stability You Can Count On &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Most startups have huge ambitions – but little or no revenue. If you've spent years of your life in an exciting new project that never really took off, you already know how frustrating it can be. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School has been highly profitable for years. We’ve never taken investor money. Our rapid growth has been funded by sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; You won’t have to worry about our company running out of money. &lt;/p&gt; 6 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Perks That Make A Difference &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To get the best results, we have to offer the best possible work conditions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Things like a top-of-the-line laptop, automated solutions for repetitive tasks, and investing in your education make your work more valuable. So providing them is a no-brainer for us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We also want you to have a sense of belonging to our team. Even if you work remotely, you'll get to meet your coworkers in person at our regular team retreats. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Whether it's rafting through the wilderness, sailing to a remote island, or participating in an ancient sauna ritual, you’ll remember these adventures for years to come. &lt;/p&gt; 7 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Join A Company You Truly Believe In &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Many people don't believe that their company creates a positive impact on the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But our company is different. We help millions of people take better photos. And we make the most beautiful online courses in the world (you can watch a sample video below). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every week we receive hundreds of heartfelt thank-you notes from our students saying we helped fill their lives with the joy of photography. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll work for a company you truly believe in. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; What Will You &lt;br/&gt; Do As A &lt;br/&gt; Hiring &lt;br/&gt; Specialist? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We get more than a thousand job applications each month. This number will continue to grow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Your job will be to review these applications and decide whether we want to continue the hiring process with each candidate. You’ll also interview the successful candidates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Over time, we'll be happy for you to take on more responsibilities in hiring. The more steps of the hiring process you can handle independently, the better it is for the company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Here’s What We Expect From You &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;li&gt; We can trust your decisions in the hiring process &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can carry out professional job interviews independently &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have the patience to go through hundreds of job applications per day &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can “sell” our company to job applicants &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have an eye for what makes a photograph or a video clip visually appealing (you’ll often have to evaluate applications for visual jobs such as video editor) &lt;/li&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is a full-time position. You can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our beautiful office in Riga, Latvia, or any paradise location. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you delay submitting your application, &lt;br/&gt; someone else will be hired before you. &lt;/p&gt;]]></content>

In fact, we're one of the most successful online education companies of any kind. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To stay at the top, we need help with hiring the best people for our team. And that's why we're looking for a &lt;b&gt;Hiring Specialist&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; 7 Reasons To Join iPhone Photography &lt;br/&gt;School As A Hiring Specialist &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 1 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Develop A Highly Marketable Skill Set In Hiring &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you know how to hire people, you’ll never be out of work. That's because every company in the world needs help with hiring. It's that simple. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But most companies don't know how to hire well. We know this because we used to be one of those companies. We’ve made so many embarrassing hiring mistakes... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Thankfully, we've learned from our mistakes. It took us 5 years and tens of thousands of job applications… But now we have one of the most efficient hiring machines in the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you want to become a hiring expert, there’s no better place to do it than with us. &lt;/p&gt; 2 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Help Brilliant People Find Their Dream Jobs &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One of the things you love the most about hiring is the people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Meeting and getting to know job applicants from all walks of life is incredibly exciting. And helping them with something as important as finding a job is truly rewarding. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We’re always looking for brilliant people to join our team. And we can offer them something very few companies can. Many of our employees say they have found their dream jobs with us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll be helping brilliant people find their dream jobs. &lt;/p&gt; 3 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Take Our Company To The Next Level &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We've been the subject of dozens of magazine articles, TV news segments, online videos and awards. People are fascinated by our success so far. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But we're only getting started. We're about to take online education to a whole new level. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Currently, our team is just 19 people. To achieve our ambitious goals we’ll need to hire many more. And these hires will make or break the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That means your work will be critical to the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; 4 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stay In Control Of Your Schedule &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every job will occasionally have emergencies and important deadlines causing you to work long hours. That's normal. But it becomes a problem when long hours are the norm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That's not how we choose to work. We want (and even ask) our team members NOT to work long hours. That's because we're building our team for the long run. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join our team, and you’ll stay in charge of your schedule. &lt;/p&gt; 5 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stability You Can Count On &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Most startups have huge ambitions – but little or no revenue. If you've spent years of your life in an exciting new project that never really took off, you already know how frustrating it can be. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School has been highly profitable for years. We’ve never taken investor money. Our rapid growth has been funded by sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; You won’t have to worry about our company running out of money. &lt;/p&gt; 6 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Perks That Make A Difference &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To get the best results, we have to offer the best possible work conditions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Things like a top-of-the-line laptop, automated solutions for repetitive tasks, and investing in your education make your work more valuable. So providing them is a no-brainer for us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We also want you to have a sense of belonging to our team. Even if you work remotely, you'll get to meet your coworkers in person at our regular team retreats. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Whether it's rafting through the wilderness, sailing to a remote island, or participating in an ancient sauna ritual, you’ll remember these adventures for years to come. &lt;/p&gt; 7 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Join A Company You Truly Believe In &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Many people don't believe that their company creates a positive impact on the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But our company is different. We help millions of people take better photos. And we make the most beautiful online courses in the world (you can watch a sample video below). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every week we receive hundreds of heartfelt thank-you notes from our students saying we helped fill their lives with the joy of photography. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll work for a company you truly believe in. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; What Will You &lt;br/&gt; Do As A &lt;br/&gt; Hiring &lt;br/&gt; Specialist? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We get more than a thousand job applications each month. This number will continue to grow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Your job will be to review these applications and decide whether we want to continue the hiring process with each candidate. You’ll also interview the successful candidates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Over time, we'll be happy for you to take on more responsibilities in hiring. The more steps of the hiring process you can handle independently, the better it is for the company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Here’s What We Expect From You &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;li&gt; We can trust your decisions in the hiring process &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can carry out professional job interviews independently &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have the patience to go through hundreds of job applications per day &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can “sell” our company to job applicants &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have an eye for what makes a photograph or a video clip visually appealing (you’ll often have to evaluate applications for visual jobs such as video editor) &lt;/li&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is a full-time position. You can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our beautiful office in Riga, Latvia, or any paradise location. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you delay submitting your application, &lt;br/&gt; someone else will be hired before you. &lt;/p&gt;]]></content>

In fact, we're one of the most successful online education companies of any kind. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To stay at the top, we need help with hiring the best people for our team. And that's why we're looking for a &lt;b&gt;Hiring Specialist&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; 7 Reasons To Join iPhone Photography &lt;br/&gt;School As A Hiring Specialist &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 1 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Develop A Highly Marketable Skill Set In Hiring &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you know how to hire people, you’ll never be out of work. That's because every company in the world needs help with hiring. It's that simple. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But most companies don't know how to hire well. We know this because we used to be one of those companies. We’ve made so many embarrassing hiring mistakes... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Thankfully, we've learned from our mistakes. It took us 5 years and tens of thousands of job applications… But now we have one of the most efficient hiring machines in the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you want to become a hiring expert, there’s no better place to do it than with us. &lt;/p&gt; 2 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Help Brilliant People Find Their Dream Jobs &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One of the things you love the most about hiring is the people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Meeting and getting to know job applicants from all walks of life is incredibly exciting. And helping them with something as important as finding a job is truly rewarding. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We’re always looking for brilliant people to join our team. And we can offer them something very few companies can. Many of our employees say they have found their dream jobs with us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll be helping brilliant people find their dream jobs. &lt;/p&gt; 3 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Take Our Company To The Next Level &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We've been the subject of dozens of magazine articles, TV news segments, online videos and awards. People are fascinated by our success so far. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But we're only getting started. We're about to take online education to a whole new level. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Currently, our team is just 19 people. To achieve our ambitious goals we’ll need to hire many more. And these hires will make or break the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That means your work will be critical to the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; 4 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stay In Control Of Your Schedule &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every job will occasionally have emergencies and important deadlines causing you to work long hours. That's normal. But it becomes a problem when long hours are the norm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That's not how we choose to work. We want (and even ask) our team members NOT to work long hours. That's because we're building our team for the long run. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join our team, and you’ll stay in charge of your schedule. &lt;/p&gt; 5 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stability You Can Count On &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Most startups have huge ambitions – but little or no revenue. If you've spent years of your life in an exciting new project that never really took off, you already know how frustrating it can be. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School has been highly profitable for years. We’ve never taken investor money. Our rapid growth has been funded by sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; You won’t have to worry about our company running out of money. &lt;/p&gt; 6 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Perks That Make A Difference &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To get the best results, we have to offer the best possible work conditions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Things like a top-of-the-line laptop, automated solutions for repetitive tasks, and investing in your education make your work more valuable. So providing them is a no-brainer for us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We also want you to have a sense of belonging to our team. Even if you work remotely, you'll get to meet your coworkers in person at our regular team retreats. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Whether it's rafting through the wilderness, sailing to a remote island, or participating in an ancient sauna ritual, you’ll remember these adventures for years to come. &lt;/p&gt; 7 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Join A Company You Truly Believe In &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Many people don't believe that their company creates a positive impact on the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But our company is different. We help millions of people take better photos. And we make the most beautiful online courses in the world (you can watch a sample video below). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every week we receive hundreds of heartfelt thank-you notes from our students saying we helped fill their lives with the joy of photography. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll work for a company you truly believe in. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; What Will You &lt;br/&gt; Do As A &lt;br/&gt; Hiring &lt;br/&gt; Specialist? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We get more than a thousand job applications each month. This number will continue to grow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Your job will be to review these applications and decide whether we want to continue the hiring process with each candidate. You’ll also interview the successful candidates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Over time, we'll be happy for you to take on more responsibilities in hiring. The more steps of the hiring process you can handle independently, the better it is for the company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Here’s What We Expect From You &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;li&gt; We can trust your decisions in the hiring process &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can carry out professional job interviews independently &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have the patience to go through hundreds of job applications per day &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can “sell” our company to job applicants &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have an eye for what makes a photograph or a video clip visually appealing (you’ll often have to evaluate applications for visual jobs such as video editor) &lt;/li&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is a full-time position. You can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our beautiful office in Riga, Latvia, or any paradise location. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you delay submitting your application, &lt;br/&gt; someone else will be hired before you. &lt;/p&gt;]]></content>

  <content><![CDATA[This is different. It&amp;#39;s exciting and it&amp;#39;s an opportunity any successful Development Chef or creative culinary genius needs to consider. Come on 2021!!!You are to be the owner of the culinary concept for RD&amp;amp;A plant-based team for this business. The go-to Developer and it&amp;#39;s not like anything we&amp;#39;ve recruited for previously.For a start - you might have to relocate twice! If that has already got you sweating, move on. Sorry, but this role is for someone so keen, excited, and (dare I say it) passionate, about plant-based food, that you&amp;#39;re willing to move counties and then countries to see it through.So, here&amp;#39;s the deal; you&amp;#39;ll be working between two sites initially&amp;hellip; starting in the East Midlands where you will work closely with the plant-based experts within NPD, you&amp;#39;ll be setting up home in Ireland! It sounds a little crazy and will be a whirlwind in the first year, but it&amp;#39;ll be exciting for sure. The induction period at the first site will provide insights and training that&amp;#39;ll be critical in you delivering your role in Ireland, 6-12 months later.A commercial mindset is needed here, as is the ability to research and develop food that goes beyond standard conventions. We&amp;#39;re looking to you as the &amp;#39;mad scientist&amp;#39; when it comes to flavour and nutrition. Mad in the most professional terms of course though. We see this role as being critical to the future growth plans and strategic plans this business has for plant-based products.Here&amp;#39;s what you need to love and live this role to the full&amp;hellip;Problem-solving at a high level. Handling multiple data sources as you consider development strategies for new culinary conceptsComfortable working independently and cross-functionally with Chefs, Scientists, and TechnologistsCapable of creating and delivering insightful presentations, preparing culinary samples to deadlinesBeing on-top of new tech and food trends that introduce novel concepts and/or new opportunities, whilst being commercially viableUltimately being the &amp;#39;go-to&amp;#39; specialist for all things plant-based; research, future trends, and innovations unlocking the plant-based opportunitiesRecipe development that unlocks plant-based opportunitiesThe ability to combine strategic and creative thinking as you support concepts over a broad spectrum for long-term innovation pipelines.You&amp;#39;re a strategic thinker, creative, and technologically savvy Chef- this position will really be a journey, but not suitable for journeymen. This will need patience, persistence, tenacity, and a will to win every single day. You might have ticked the boxes above but do consider the long-term nature of this role and the personal investment in time and energy you will make for it.Culinary expertise is non-negotiable here. You need to come from a high-end background and ideally have worked successfully over a sustained period within molecular gastronomy. New Product Development experience within a food manufacturer is hugely beneficial, but if you have genuine potential to unlock because of your molecular gastronomy experience that will be considered too.An inquisitive mind, never standing still is a must-have here. You&amp;#39;ll really relish research and take pride in investigating new recipes and how food ingredients interact with plant-based formulation processes. &amp;#39;Self-starter&amp;#39; doesn&amp;#39;t really do it justice. Your constant desire to create, explore and analyse ideas and recipes will serve you well in this position.You might not be a scientist per-se, but you will be working with Technologists and scientists within this company, so interest is key here. An ability to learn and an aptitude to understand this long-term will be a big factor in your success.It&amp;#39;s not for the faint-hearted, and it&amp;#39;s not for someone unsure where they want their career to go. But, if you are definite about the plant-based category and you know that you can make a genuinely positive and impactful contribution, then we want to hear from you.Ref FTL(phone number removed)Tel: +44 (0)(phone number removed)Follow Focus Management on Twitter @foodjob, Instagram @focus_recruitment &amp;amp; Linkedin @Focus Management Consultants]]></content>

In fact, we're one of the most successful online education companies of any kind. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To stay at the top, we need help with hiring the best people for our team. And that's why we're looking for a &lt;b&gt;Hiring Specialist&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; 7 Reasons To Join iPhone Photography &lt;br/&gt;School As A Hiring Specialist &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 1 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Develop A Highly Marketable Skill Set In Hiring &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you know how to hire people, you’ll never be out of work. That's because every company in the world needs help with hiring. It's that simple. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But most companies don't know how to hire well. We know this because we used to be one of those companies. We’ve made so many embarrassing hiring mistakes... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Thankfully, we've learned from our mistakes. It took us 5 years and tens of thousands of job applications… But now we have one of the most efficient hiring machines in the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you want to become a hiring expert, there’s no better place to do it than with us. &lt;/p&gt; 2 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Help Brilliant People Find Their Dream Jobs &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One of the things you love the most about hiring is the people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Meeting and getting to know job applicants from all walks of life is incredibly exciting. And helping them with something as important as finding a job is truly rewarding. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We’re always looking for brilliant people to join our team. And we can offer them something very few companies can. Many of our employees say they have found their dream jobs with us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll be helping brilliant people find their dream jobs. &lt;/p&gt; 3 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Take Our Company To The Next Level &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We've been the subject of dozens of magazine articles, TV news segments, online videos and awards. People are fascinated by our success so far. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But we're only getting started. We're about to take online education to a whole new level. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Currently, our team is just 19 people. To achieve our ambitious goals we’ll need to hire many more. And these hires will make or break the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That means your work will be critical to the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; 4 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stay In Control Of Your Schedule &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every job will occasionally have emergencies and important deadlines causing you to work long hours. That's normal. But it becomes a problem when long hours are the norm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That's not how we choose to work. We want (and even ask) our team members NOT to work long hours. That's because we're building our team for the long run. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join our team, and you’ll stay in charge of your schedule. &lt;/p&gt; 5 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stability You Can Count On &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Most startups have huge ambitions – but little or no revenue. If you've spent years of your life in an exciting new project that never really took off, you already know how frustrating it can be. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School has been highly profitable for years. We’ve never taken investor money. Our rapid growth has been funded by sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; You won’t have to worry about our company running out of money. &lt;/p&gt; 6 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Perks That Make A Difference &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To get the best results, we have to offer the best possible work conditions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Things like a top-of-the-line laptop, automated solutions for repetitive tasks, and investing in your education make your work more valuable. So providing them is a no-brainer for us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We also want you to have a sense of belonging to our team. Even if you work remotely, you'll get to meet your coworkers in person at our regular team retreats. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Whether it's rafting through the wilderness, sailing to a remote island, or participating in an ancient sauna ritual, you’ll remember these adventures for years to come. &lt;/p&gt; 7 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Join A Company You Truly Believe In &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Many people don't believe that their company creates a positive impact on the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But our company is different. We help millions of people take better photos. And we make the most beautiful online courses in the world (you can watch a sample video below). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every week we receive hundreds of heartfelt thank-you notes from our students saying we helped fill their lives with the joy of photography. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll work for a company you truly believe in. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; What Will You &lt;br/&gt; Do As A &lt;br/&gt; Hiring &lt;br/&gt; Specialist? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We get more than a thousand job applications each month. This number will continue to grow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Your job will be to review these applications and decide whether we want to continue the hiring process with each candidate. You’ll also interview the successful candidates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Over time, we'll be happy for you to take on more responsibilities in hiring. The more steps of the hiring process you can handle independently, the better it is for the company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Here’s What We Expect From You &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;li&gt; We can trust your decisions in the hiring process &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can carry out professional job interviews independently &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have the patience to go through hundreds of job applications per day &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can “sell” our company to job applicants &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have an eye for what makes a photograph or a video clip visually appealing (you’ll often have to evaluate applications for visual jobs such as video editor) &lt;/li&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is a full-time position. You can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our beautiful office in Riga, Latvia, or any paradise location. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you delay submitting your application, &lt;br/&gt; someone else will be hired before you. &lt;/p&gt;]]></content>

In fact, we're one of the most successful online education companies of any kind. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To stay at the top, we need help with hiring the best people for our team. And that's why we're looking for a &lt;b&gt;Hiring Specialist&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; 7 Reasons To Join iPhone Photography &lt;br/&gt;School As A Hiring Specialist &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 1 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Develop A Highly Marketable Skill Set In Hiring &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you know how to hire people, you’ll never be out of work. That's because every company in the world needs help with hiring. It's that simple. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But most companies don't know how to hire well. We know this because we used to be one of those companies. We’ve made so many embarrassing hiring mistakes... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Thankfully, we've learned from our mistakes. It took us 5 years and tens of thousands of job applications… But now we have one of the most efficient hiring machines in the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you want to become a hiring expert, there’s no better place to do it than with us. &lt;/p&gt; 2 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Help Brilliant People Find Their Dream Jobs &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One of the things you love the most about hiring is the people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Meeting and getting to know job applicants from all walks of life is incredibly exciting. And helping them with something as important as finding a job is truly rewarding. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We’re always looking for brilliant people to join our team. And we can offer them something very few companies can. Many of our employees say they have found their dream jobs with us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll be helping brilliant people find their dream jobs. &lt;/p&gt; 3 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Take Our Company To The Next Level &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We've been the subject of dozens of magazine articles, TV news segments, online videos and awards. People are fascinated by our success so far. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But we're only getting started. We're about to take online education to a whole new level. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Currently, our team is just 19 people. To achieve our ambitious goals we’ll need to hire many more. And these hires will make or break the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That means your work will be critical to the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; 4 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stay In Control Of Your Schedule &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every job will occasionally have emergencies and important deadlines causing you to work long hours. That's normal. But it becomes a problem when long hours are the norm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That's not how we choose to work. We want (and even ask) our team members NOT to work long hours. That's because we're building our team for the long run. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join our team, and you’ll stay in charge of your schedule. &lt;/p&gt; 5 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stability You Can Count On &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Most startups have huge ambitions – but little or no revenue. If you've spent years of your life in an exciting new project that never really took off, you already know how frustrating it can be. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School has been highly profitable for years. We’ve never taken investor money. Our rapid growth has been funded by sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; You won’t have to worry about our company running out of money. &lt;/p&gt; 6 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Perks That Make A Difference &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To get the best results, we have to offer the best possible work conditions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Things like a top-of-the-line laptop, automated solutions for repetitive tasks, and investing in your education make your work more valuable. So providing them is a no-brainer for us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We also want you to have a sense of belonging to our team. Even if you work remotely, you'll get to meet your coworkers in person at our regular team retreats. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Whether it's rafting through the wilderness, sailing to a remote island, or participating in an ancient sauna ritual, you’ll remember these adventures for years to come. &lt;/p&gt; 7 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Join A Company You Truly Believe In &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Many people don't believe that their company creates a positive impact on the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But our company is different. We help millions of people take better photos. And we make the most beautiful online courses in the world (you can watch a sample video below). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every week we receive hundreds of heartfelt thank-you notes from our students saying we helped fill their lives with the joy of photography. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll work for a company you truly believe in. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; What Will You &lt;br/&gt; Do As A &lt;br/&gt; Hiring &lt;br/&gt; Specialist? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We get more than a thousand job applications each month. This number will continue to grow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Your job will be to review these applications and decide whether we want to continue the hiring process with each candidate. You’ll also interview the successful candidates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Over time, we'll be happy for you to take on more responsibilities in hiring. The more steps of the hiring process you can handle independently, the better it is for the company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Here’s What We Expect From You &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;li&gt; We can trust your decisions in the hiring process &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can carry out professional job interviews independently &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have the patience to go through hundreds of job applications per day &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can “sell” our company to job applicants &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have an eye for what makes a photograph or a video clip visually appealing (you’ll often have to evaluate applications for visual jobs such as video editor) &lt;/li&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is a full-time position. You can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our beautiful office in Riga, Latvia, or any paradise location. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you delay submitting your application, &lt;br/&gt; someone else will be hired before you. &lt;/p&gt;]]></content>

In fact, we're one of the most successful online education companies of any kind. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To stay at the top, we need help with hiring the best people for our team. And that's why we're looking for a &lt;b&gt;Hiring Specialist&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; 7 Reasons To Join iPhone Photography &lt;br/&gt;School As A Hiring Specialist &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 1 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Develop A Highly Marketable Skill Set In Hiring &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you know how to hire people, you’ll never be out of work. That's because every company in the world needs help with hiring. It's that simple. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But most companies don't know how to hire well. We know this because we used to be one of those companies. We’ve made so many embarrassing hiring mistakes... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Thankfully, we've learned from our mistakes. It took us 5 years and tens of thousands of job applications… But now we have one of the most efficient hiring machines in the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you want to become a hiring expert, there’s no better place to do it than with us. &lt;/p&gt; 2 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Help Brilliant People Find Their Dream Jobs &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One of the things you love the most about hiring is the people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Meeting and getting to know job applicants from all walks of life is incredibly exciting. And helping them with something as important as finding a job is truly rewarding. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We’re always looking for brilliant people to join our team. And we can offer them something very few companies can. Many of our employees say they have found their dream jobs with us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll be helping brilliant people find their dream jobs. &lt;/p&gt; 3 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Take Our Company To The Next Level &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We've been the subject of dozens of magazine articles, TV news segments, online videos and awards. People are fascinated by our success so far. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But we're only getting started. We're about to take online education to a whole new level. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Currently, our team is just 19 people. To achieve our ambitious goals we’ll need to hire many more. And these hires will make or break the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That means your work will be critical to the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; 4 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stay In Control Of Your Schedule &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every job will occasionally have emergencies and important deadlines causing you to work long hours. That's normal. But it becomes a problem when long hours are the norm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That's not how we choose to work. We want (and even ask) our team members NOT to work long hours. That's because we're building our team for the long run. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join our team, and you’ll stay in charge of your schedule. &lt;/p&gt; 5 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stability You Can Count On &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Most startups have huge ambitions – but little or no revenue. If you've spent years of your life in an exciting new project that never really took off, you already know how frustrating it can be. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School has been highly profitable for years. We’ve never taken investor money. Our rapid growth has been funded by sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; You won’t have to worry about our company running out of money. &lt;/p&gt; 6 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Perks That Make A Difference &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To get the best results, we have to offer the best possible work conditions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Things like a top-of-the-line laptop, automated solutions for repetitive tasks, and investing in your education make your work more valuable. So providing them is a no-brainer for us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We also want you to have a sense of belonging to our team. Even if you work remotely, you'll get to meet your coworkers in person at our regular team retreats. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Whether it's rafting through the wilderness, sailing to a remote island, or participating in an ancient sauna ritual, you’ll remember these adventures for years to come. &lt;/p&gt; 7 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Join A Company You Truly Believe In &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Many people don't believe that their company creates a positive impact on the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But our company is different. We help millions of people take better photos. And we make the most beautiful online courses in the world (you can watch a sample video below). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every week we receive hundreds of heartfelt thank-you notes from our students saying we helped fill their lives with the joy of photography. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll work for a company you truly believe in. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; What Will You &lt;br/&gt; Do As A &lt;br/&gt; Hiring &lt;br/&gt; Specialist? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We get more than a thousand job applications each month. This number will continue to grow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Your job will be to review these applications and decide whether we want to continue the hiring process with each candidate. You’ll also interview the successful candidates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Over time, we'll be happy for you to take on more responsibilities in hiring. The more steps of the hiring process you can handle independently, the better it is for the company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Here’s What We Expect From You &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;li&gt; We can trust your decisions in the hiring process &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can carry out professional job interviews independently &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have the patience to go through hundreds of job applications per day &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can “sell” our company to job applicants &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have an eye for what makes a photograph or a video clip visually appealing (you’ll often have to evaluate applications for visual jobs such as video editor) &lt;/li&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is a full-time position. You can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our beautiful office in Riga, Latvia, or any paradise location. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you delay submitting your application, &lt;br/&gt; someone else will be hired before you. &lt;/p&gt;]]></content>

In fact, we're one of the most successful online education companies of any kind. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To stay at the top, we need help with hiring the best people for our team. And that's why we're looking for a &lt;b&gt;Hiring Specialist&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; 7 Reasons To Join iPhone Photography &lt;br/&gt;School As A Hiring Specialist &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 1 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Develop A Highly Marketable Skill Set In Hiring &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you know how to hire people, you’ll never be out of work. That's because every company in the world needs help with hiring. It's that simple. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But most companies don't know how to hire well. We know this because we used to be one of those companies. We’ve made so many embarrassing hiring mistakes... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Thankfully, we've learned from our mistakes. It took us 5 years and tens of thousands of job applications… But now we have one of the most efficient hiring machines in the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you want to become a hiring expert, there’s no better place to do it than with us. &lt;/p&gt; 2 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Help Brilliant People Find Their Dream Jobs &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One of the things you love the most about hiring is the people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Meeting and getting to know job applicants from all walks of life is incredibly exciting. And helping them with something as important as finding a job is truly rewarding. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We’re always looking for brilliant people to join our team. And we can offer them something very few companies can. Many of our employees say they have found their dream jobs with us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll be helping brilliant people find their dream jobs. &lt;/p&gt; 3 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Take Our Company To The Next Level &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We've been the subject of dozens of magazine articles, TV news segments, online videos and awards. People are fascinated by our success so far. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But we're only getting started. We're about to take online education to a whole new level. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Currently, our team is just 19 people. To achieve our ambitious goals we’ll need to hire many more. And these hires will make or break the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That means your work will be critical to the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; 4 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stay In Control Of Your Schedule &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every job will occasionally have emergencies and important deadlines causing you to work long hours. That's normal. But it becomes a problem when long hours are the norm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That's not how we choose to work. We want (and even ask) our team members NOT to work long hours. That's because we're building our team for the long run. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join our team, and you’ll stay in charge of your schedule. &lt;/p&gt; 5 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stability You Can Count On &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Most startups have huge ambitions – but little or no revenue. If you've spent years of your life in an exciting new project that never really took off, you already know how frustrating it can be. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School has been highly profitable for years. We’ve never taken investor money. Our rapid growth has been funded by sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; You won’t have to worry about our company running out of money. &lt;/p&gt; 6 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Perks That Make A Difference &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To get the best results, we have to offer the best possible work conditions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Things like a top-of-the-line laptop, automated solutions for repetitive tasks, and investing in your education make your work more valuable. So providing them is a no-brainer for us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We also want you to have a sense of belonging to our team. Even if you work remotely, you'll get to meet your coworkers in person at our regular team retreats. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Whether it's rafting through the wilderness, sailing to a remote island, or participating in an ancient sauna ritual, you’ll remember these adventures for years to come. &lt;/p&gt; 7 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Join A Company You Truly Believe In &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Many people don't believe that their company creates a positive impact on the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But our company is different. We help millions of people take better photos. And we make the most beautiful online courses in the world (you can watch a sample video below). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every week we receive hundreds of heartfelt thank-you notes from our students saying we helped fill their lives with the joy of photography. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll work for a company you truly believe in. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; What Will You &lt;br/&gt; Do As A &lt;br/&gt; Hiring &lt;br/&gt; Specialist? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We get more than a thousand job applications each month. This number will continue to grow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Your job will be to review these applications and decide whether we want to continue the hiring process with each candidate. You’ll also interview the successful candidates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Over time, we'll be happy for you to take on more responsibilities in hiring. The more steps of the hiring process you can handle independently, the better it is for the company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Here’s What We Expect From You &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;li&gt; We can trust your decisions in the hiring process &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can carry out professional job interviews independently &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have the patience to go through hundreds of job applications per day &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can “sell” our company to job applicants &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have an eye for what makes a photograph or a video clip visually appealing (you’ll often have to evaluate applications for visual jobs such as video editor) &lt;/li&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is a full-time position. You can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our beautiful office in Riga, Latvia, or any paradise location. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you delay submitting your application, &lt;br/&gt; someone else will be hired before you. &lt;/p&gt;]]></content>

In fact, we're one of the most successful online education companies of any kind. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To stay at the top, we need help with hiring the best people for our team. And that's why we're looking for a &lt;b&gt;Hiring Specialist&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; 7 Reasons To Join iPhone Photography &lt;br/&gt;School As A Hiring Specialist &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 1 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Develop A Highly Marketable Skill Set In Hiring &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you know how to hire people, you’ll never be out of work. That's because every company in the world needs help with hiring. It's that simple. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But most companies don't know how to hire well. We know this because we used to be one of those companies. We’ve made so many embarrassing hiring mistakes... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Thankfully, we've learned from our mistakes. It took us 5 years and tens of thousands of job applications… But now we have one of the most efficient hiring machines in the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you want to become a hiring expert, there’s no better place to do it than with us. &lt;/p&gt; 2 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Help Brilliant People Find Their Dream Jobs &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One of the things you love the most about hiring is the people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Meeting and getting to know job applicants from all walks of life is incredibly exciting. And helping them with something as important as finding a job is truly rewarding. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We’re always looking for brilliant people to join our team. And we can offer them something very few companies can. Many of our employees say they have found their dream jobs with us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll be helping brilliant people find their dream jobs. &lt;/p&gt; 3 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Take Our Company To The Next Level &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We've been the subject of dozens of magazine articles, TV news segments, online videos and awards. People are fascinated by our success so far. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But we're only getting started. We're about to take online education to a whole new level. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Currently, our team is just 19 people. To achieve our ambitious goals we’ll need to hire many more. And these hires will make or break the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That means your work will be critical to the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; 4 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stay In Control Of Your Schedule &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every job will occasionally have emergencies and important deadlines causing you to work long hours. That's normal. But it becomes a problem when long hours are the norm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That's not how we choose to work. We want (and even ask) our team members NOT to work long hours. That's because we're building our team for the long run. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join our team, and you’ll stay in charge of your schedule. &lt;/p&gt; 5 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stability You Can Count On &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Most startups have huge ambitions – but little or no revenue. If you've spent years of your life in an exciting new project that never really took off, you already know how frustrating it can be. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School has been highly profitable for years. We’ve never taken investor money. Our rapid growth has been funded by sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; You won’t have to worry about our company running out of money. &lt;/p&gt; 6 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Perks That Make A Difference &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To get the best results, we have to offer the best possible work conditions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Things like a top-of-the-line laptop, automated solutions for repetitive tasks, and investing in your education make your work more valuable. So providing them is a no-brainer for us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We also want you to have a sense of belonging to our team. Even if you work remotely, you'll get to meet your coworkers in person at our regular team retreats. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Whether it's rafting through the wilderness, sailing to a remote island, or participating in an ancient sauna ritual, you’ll remember these adventures for years to come. &lt;/p&gt; 7 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Join A Company You Truly Believe In &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Many people don't believe that their company creates a positive impact on the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But our company is different. We help millions of people take better photos. And we make the most beautiful online courses in the world (you can watch a sample video below). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every week we receive hundreds of heartfelt thank-you notes from our students saying we helped fill their lives with the joy of photography. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll work for a company you truly believe in. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; What Will You &lt;br/&gt; Do As A &lt;br/&gt; Hiring &lt;br/&gt; Specialist? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We get more than a thousand job applications each month. This number will continue to grow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Your job will be to review these applications and decide whether we want to continue the hiring process with each candidate. You’ll also interview the successful candidates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Over time, we'll be happy for you to take on more responsibilities in hiring. The more steps of the hiring process you can handle independently, the better it is for the company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Here’s What We Expect From You &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;li&gt; We can trust your decisions in the hiring process &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can carry out professional job interviews independently &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have the patience to go through hundreds of job applications per day &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can “sell” our company to job applicants &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have an eye for what makes a photograph or a video clip visually appealing (you’ll often have to evaluate applications for visual jobs such as video editor) &lt;/li&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is a full-time position. You can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our beautiful office in Riga, Latvia, or any paradise location. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you delay submitting your application, &lt;br/&gt; someone else will be hired before you. &lt;/p&gt;]]></content>

In fact, we're one of the most successful online education companies of any kind. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To stay at the top, we need help with hiring the best people for our team. And that's why we're looking for a &lt;b&gt;Hiring Specialist&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; 7 Reasons To Join iPhone Photography &lt;br/&gt;School As A Hiring Specialist &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 1 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Develop A Highly Marketable Skill Set In Hiring &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you know how to hire people, you’ll never be out of work. That's because every company in the world needs help with hiring. It's that simple. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But most companies don't know how to hire well. We know this because we used to be one of those companies. We’ve made so many embarrassing hiring mistakes... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Thankfully, we've learned from our mistakes. It took us 5 years and tens of thousands of job applications… But now we have one of the most efficient hiring machines in the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you want to become a hiring expert, there’s no better place to do it than with us. &lt;/p&gt; 2 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Help Brilliant People Find Their Dream Jobs &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One of the things you love the most about hiring is the people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Meeting and getting to know job applicants from all walks of life is incredibly exciting. And helping them with something as important as finding a job is truly rewarding. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We’re always looking for brilliant people to join our team. And we can offer them something very few companies can. Many of our employees say they have found their dream jobs with us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll be helping brilliant people find their dream jobs. &lt;/p&gt; 3 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Take Our Company To The Next Level &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We've been the subject of dozens of magazine articles, TV news segments, online videos and awards. People are fascinated by our success so far. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But we're only getting started. We're about to take online education to a whole new level. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Currently, our team is just 19 people. To achieve our ambitious goals we’ll need to hire many more. And these hires will make or break the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That means your work will be critical to the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; 4 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stay In Control Of Your Schedule &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every job will occasionally have emergencies and important deadlines causing you to work long hours. That's normal. But it becomes a problem when long hours are the norm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That's not how we choose to work. We want (and even ask) our team members NOT to work long hours. That's because we're building our team for the long run. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join our team, and you’ll stay in charge of your schedule. &lt;/p&gt; 5 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stability You Can Count On &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Most startups have huge ambitions – but little or no revenue. If you've spent years of your life in an exciting new project that never really took off, you already know how frustrating it can be. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School has been highly profitable for years. We’ve never taken investor money. Our rapid growth has been funded by sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; You won’t have to worry about our company running out of money. &lt;/p&gt; 6 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Perks That Make A Difference &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To get the best results, we have to offer the best possible work conditions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Things like a top-of-the-line laptop, automated solutions for repetitive tasks, and investing in your education make your work more valuable. So providing them is a no-brainer for us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We also want you to have a sense of belonging to our team. Even if you work remotely, you'll get to meet your coworkers in person at our regular team retreats. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Whether it's rafting through the wilderness, sailing to a remote island, or participating in an ancient sauna ritual, you’ll remember these adventures for years to come. &lt;/p&gt; 7 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Join A Company You Truly Believe In &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Many people don't believe that their company creates a positive impact on the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But our company is different. We help millions of people take better photos. And we make the most beautiful online courses in the world (you can watch a sample video below). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every week we receive hundreds of heartfelt thank-you notes from our students saying we helped fill their lives with the joy of photography. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll work for a company you truly believe in. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; What Will You &lt;br/&gt; Do As A &lt;br/&gt; Hiring &lt;br/&gt; Specialist? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We get more than a thousand job applications each month. This number will continue to grow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Your job will be to review these applications and decide whether we want to continue the hiring process with each candidate. You’ll also interview the successful candidates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Over time, we'll be happy for you to take on more responsibilities in hiring. The more steps of the hiring process you can handle independently, the better it is for the company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Here’s What We Expect From You &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;li&gt; We can trust your decisions in the hiring process &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can carry out professional job interviews independently &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have the patience to go through hundreds of job applications per day &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can “sell” our company to job applicants &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have an eye for what makes a photograph or a video clip visually appealing (you’ll often have to evaluate applications for visual jobs such as video editor) &lt;/li&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is a full-time position. You can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our beautiful office in Riga, Latvia, or any paradise location. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you delay submitting your application, &lt;br/&gt; someone else will be hired before you. &lt;/p&gt;]]></content>

  <content><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; You’ve finally &lt;br/&gt;found it… &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The perfect job opportunity to skyrocket your career in hiring. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If that's what you've been looking for, &lt;b&gt;then this page could literally change your life!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But only if you keep reading. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; iPhone Photography School is the world's leading resource on iPhone photography. In fact, we're one of the most successful online education companies of any kind. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To stay at the top, we need help with hiring the best people for our team. And that's why we're looking for a &lt;b&gt;Hiring Specialist&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; 7 Reasons To Join iPhone Photography &lt;br/&gt;School As A Hiring Specialist &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 1 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Develop A Highly Marketable Skill Set In Hiring &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you know how to hire people, you’ll never be out of work. That's because every company in the world needs help with hiring. It's that simple. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But most companies don't know how to hire well. We know this because we used to be one of those companies. We’ve made so many embarrassing hiring mistakes... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Thankfully, we've learned from our mistakes. It took us 5 years and tens of thousands of job applications… But now we have one of the most efficient hiring machines in the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you want to become a hiring expert, there’s no better place to do it than with us. &lt;/p&gt; 2 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Help Brilliant People Find Their Dream Jobs &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One of the things you love the most about hiring is the people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Meeting and getting to know job applicants from all walks of life is incredibly exciting. And helping them with something as important as finding a job is truly rewarding. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We’re always looking for brilliant people to join our team. And we can offer them something very few companies can. Many of our employees say they have found their dream jobs with us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll be helping brilliant people find their dream jobs. &lt;/p&gt; 3 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Take Our Company To The Next Level &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We've been the subject of dozens of magazine articles, TV news segments, online videos and awards. People are fascinated by our success so far. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But we're only getting started. We're about to take online education to a whole new level. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Currently, our team is just 19 people. To achieve our ambitious goals we’ll need to hire many more. And these hires will make or break the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That means your work will be critical to the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; 4 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stay In Control Of Your Schedule &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every job will occasionally have emergencies and important deadlines causing you to work long hours. That's normal. But it becomes a problem when long hours are the norm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That's not how we choose to work. We want (and even ask) our team members NOT to work long hours. That's because we're building our team for the long run. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join our team, and you’ll stay in charge of your schedule. &lt;/p&gt; 5 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stability You Can Count On &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Most startups have huge ambitions – but little or no revenue. If you've spent years of your life in an exciting new project that never really took off, you already know how frustrating it can be. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School has been highly profitable for years. We’ve never taken investor money. Our rapid growth has been funded by sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; You won’t have to worry about our company running out of money. &lt;/p&gt; 6 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Perks That Make A Difference &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To get the best results, we have to offer the best possible work conditions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Things like a top-of-the-line laptop, automated solutions for repetitive tasks, and investing in your education make your work more valuable. So providing them is a no-brainer for us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We also want you to have a sense of belonging to our team. Even if you work remotely, you'll get to meet your coworkers in person at our regular team retreats. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Whether it's rafting through the wilderness, sailing to a remote island, or participating in an ancient sauna ritual, you’ll remember these adventures for years to come. &lt;/p&gt; 7 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Join A Company You Truly Believe In &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Many people don't believe that their company creates a positive impact on the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But our company is different. We help millions of people take better photos. And we make the most beautiful online courses in the world (you can watch a sample video below). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every week we receive hundreds of heartfelt thank-you notes from our students saying we helped fill their lives with the joy of photography. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll work for a company you truly believe in. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; What Will You &lt;br/&gt; Do As A &lt;br/&gt; Hiring &lt;br/&gt; Specialist? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We get more than a thousand job applications each month. This number will continue to grow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Your job will be to review these applications and decide whether we want to continue the hiring process with each candidate. You’ll also interview the successful candidates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Over time, we'll be happy for you to take on more responsibilities in hiring. The more steps of the hiring process you can handle independently, the better it is for the company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Here’s What We Expect From You &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;li&gt; We can trust your decisions in the hiring process &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can carry out professional job interviews independently &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have the patience to go through hundreds of job applications per day &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can “sell” our company to job applicants &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have an eye for what makes a photograph or a video clip visually appealing (you’ll often have to evaluate applications for visual jobs such as video editor) &lt;/li&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is a full-time position. You can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our beautiful office in Riga, Latvia, or any paradise location. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you delay submitting your application, &lt;br/&gt; someone else will be hired before you. &lt;/p&gt;]]></content>

  <content><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; You’ve finally &lt;br/&gt;found it… &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The perfect job opportunity to skyrocket your career in hiring. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If that's what you've been looking for, &lt;b&gt;then this page could literally change your life!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But only if you keep reading. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; iPhone Photography School is the world's leading resource on iPhone photography. In fact, we're one of the most successful online education companies of any kind. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To stay at the top, we need help with hiring the best people for our team. And that's why we're looking for a &lt;b&gt;Hiring Specialist&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; 7 Reasons To Join iPhone Photography &lt;br/&gt;School As A Hiring Specialist &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 1 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Develop A Highly Marketable Skill Set In Hiring &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you know how to hire people, you’ll never be out of work. That's because every company in the world needs help with hiring. It's that simple. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But most companies don't know how to hire well. We know this because we used to be one of those companies. We’ve made so many embarrassing hiring mistakes... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Thankfully, we've learned from our mistakes. It took us 5 years and tens of thousands of job applications… But now we have one of the most efficient hiring machines in the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you want to become a hiring expert, there’s no better place to do it than with us. &lt;/p&gt; 2 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Help Brilliant People Find Their Dream Jobs &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One of the things you love the most about hiring is the people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Meeting and getting to know job applicants from all walks of life is incredibly exciting. And helping them with something as important as finding a job is truly rewarding. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We’re always looking for brilliant people to join our team. And we can offer them something very few companies can. Many of our employees say they have found their dream jobs with us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll be helping brilliant people find their dream jobs. &lt;/p&gt; 3 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Take Our Company To The Next Level &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We've been the subject of dozens of magazine articles, TV news segments, online videos and awards. People are fascinated by our success so far. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But we're only getting started. We're about to take online education to a whole new level. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Currently, our team is just 19 people. To achieve our ambitious goals we’ll need to hire many more. And these hires will make or break the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That means your work will be critical to the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; 4 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stay In Control Of Your Schedule &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every job will occasionally have emergencies and important deadlines causing you to work long hours. That's normal. But it becomes a problem when long hours are the norm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That's not how we choose to work. We want (and even ask) our team members NOT to work long hours. That's because we're building our team for the long run. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join our team, and you’ll stay in charge of your schedule. &lt;/p&gt; 5 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stability You Can Count On &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Most startups have huge ambitions – but little or no revenue. If you've spent years of your life in an exciting new project that never really took off, you already know how frustrating it can be. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School has been highly profitable for years. We’ve never taken investor money. Our rapid growth has been funded by sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; You won’t have to worry about our company running out of money. &lt;/p&gt; 6 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Perks That Make A Difference &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To get the best results, we have to offer the best possible work conditions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Things like a top-of-the-line laptop, automated solutions for repetitive tasks, and investing in your education make your work more valuable. So providing them is a no-brainer for us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We also want you to have a sense of belonging to our team. Even if you work remotely, you'll get to meet your coworkers in person at our regular team retreats. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Whether it's rafting through the wilderness, sailing to a remote island, or participating in an ancient sauna ritual, you’ll remember these adventures for years to come. &lt;/p&gt; 7 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Join A Company You Truly Believe In &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Many people don't believe that their company creates a positive impact on the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But our company is different. We help millions of people take better photos. And we make the most beautiful online courses in the world (you can watch a sample video below). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every week we receive hundreds of heartfelt thank-you notes from our students saying we helped fill their lives with the joy of photography. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll work for a company you truly believe in. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; What Will You &lt;br/&gt; Do As A &lt;br/&gt; Hiring &lt;br/&gt; Specialist? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We get more than a thousand job applications each month. This number will continue to grow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Your job will be to review these applications and decide whether we want to continue the hiring process with each candidate. You’ll also interview the successful candidates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Over time, we'll be happy for you to take on more responsibilities in hiring. The more steps of the hiring process you can handle independently, the better it is for the company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Here’s What We Expect From You &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;li&gt; We can trust your decisions in the hiring process &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can carry out professional job interviews independently &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have the patience to go through hundreds of job applications per day &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can “sell” our company to job applicants &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have an eye for what makes a photograph or a video clip visually appealing (you’ll often have to evaluate applications for visual jobs such as video editor) &lt;/li&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is a full-time position. You can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our beautiful office in Riga, Latvia, or any paradise location. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you delay submitting your application, &lt;br/&gt; someone else will be hired before you. &lt;/p&gt;]]></content>

In fact, we're one of the most successful online education companies of any kind. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To stay at the top, we need help with hiring the best people for our team. And that's why we're looking for a &lt;b&gt;Hiring Specialist&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; 7 Reasons To Join iPhone Photography &lt;br/&gt;School As A Hiring Specialist &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 1 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Develop A Highly Marketable Skill Set In Hiring &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you know how to hire people, you’ll never be out of work. That's because every company in the world needs help with hiring. It's that simple. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But most companies don't know how to hire well. We know this because we used to be one of those companies. We’ve made so many embarrassing hiring mistakes... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Thankfully, we've learned from our mistakes. It took us 5 years and tens of thousands of job applications… But now we have one of the most efficient hiring machines in the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you want to become a hiring expert, there’s no better place to do it than with us. &lt;/p&gt; 2 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Help Brilliant People Find Their Dream Jobs &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One of the things you love the most about hiring is the people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Meeting and getting to know job applicants from all walks of life is incredibly exciting. And helping them with something as important as finding a job is truly rewarding. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We’re always looking for brilliant people to join our team. And we can offer them something very few companies can. Many of our employees say they have found their dream jobs with us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll be helping brilliant people find their dream jobs. &lt;/p&gt; 3 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Take Our Company To The Next Level &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We've been the subject of dozens of magazine articles, TV news segments, online videos and awards. People are fascinated by our success so far. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But we're only getting started. We're about to take online education to a whole new level. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Currently, our team is just 19 people. To achieve our ambitious goals we’ll need to hire many more. And these hires will make or break the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That means your work will be critical to the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; 4 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stay In Control Of Your Schedule &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every job will occasionally have emergencies and important deadlines causing you to work long hours. That's normal. But it becomes a problem when long hours are the norm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That's not how we choose to work. We want (and even ask) our team members NOT to work long hours. That's because we're building our team for the long run. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join our team, and you’ll stay in charge of your schedule. &lt;/p&gt; 5 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stability You Can Count On &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Most startups have huge ambitions – but little or no revenue. If you've spent years of your life in an exciting new project that never really took off, you already know how frustrating it can be. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School has been highly profitable for years. We’ve never taken investor money. Our rapid growth has been funded by sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; You won’t have to worry about our company running out of money. &lt;/p&gt; 6 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Perks That Make A Difference &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To get the best results, we have to offer the best possible work conditions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Things like a top-of-the-line laptop, automated solutions for repetitive tasks, and investing in your education make your work more valuable. So providing them is a no-brainer for us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We also want you to have a sense of belonging to our team. Even if you work remotely, you'll get to meet your coworkers in person at our regular team retreats. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Whether it's rafting through the wilderness, sailing to a remote island, or participating in an ancient sauna ritual, you’ll remember these adventures for years to come. &lt;/p&gt; 7 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Join A Company You Truly Believe In &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Many people don't believe that their company creates a positive impact on the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But our company is different. We help millions of people take better photos. And we make the most beautiful online courses in the world (you can watch a sample video below). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every week we receive hundreds of heartfelt thank-you notes from our students saying we helped fill their lives with the joy of photography. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll work for a company you truly believe in. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; What Will You &lt;br/&gt; Do As A &lt;br/&gt; Hiring &lt;br/&gt; Specialist? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We get more than a thousand job applications each month. This number will continue to grow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Your job will be to review these applications and decide whether we want to continue the hiring process with each candidate. You’ll also interview the successful candidates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Over time, we'll be happy for you to take on more responsibilities in hiring. The more steps of the hiring process you can handle independently, the better it is for the company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Here’s What We Expect From You &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;li&gt; We can trust your decisions in the hiring process &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can carry out professional job interviews independently &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have the patience to go through hundreds of job applications per day &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can “sell” our company to job applicants &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have an eye for what makes a photograph or a video clip visually appealing (you’ll often have to evaluate applications for visual jobs such as video editor) &lt;/li&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is a full-time position. You can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our beautiful office in Riga, Latvia, or any paradise location. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you delay submitting your application, &lt;br/&gt; someone else will be hired before you. &lt;/p&gt;]]></content>

That's because every company in the world needs help with hiring. It's that simple. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But most companies don't know how to hire well. We know this because we used to be one of those companies. We’ve made so many embarrassing hiring mistakes... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Thankfully, we've learned from our mistakes. It took us 5 years and tens of thousands of job applications… But now we have one of the most efficient hiring machines in the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you want to become a hiring expert, there’s no better place to do it than with us. &lt;/p&gt; 2 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Help Brilliant People Find Their Dream Jobs &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One of the things you love the most about hiring is the people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Meeting and getting to know job applicants from all walks of life is incredibly exciting. And helping them with something as important as finding a job is truly rewarding. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We’re always looking for brilliant people to join our team. And we can offer them something very few companies can. Many of our employees say they have found their dream jobs with us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll be helping brilliant people find their dream jobs. &lt;/p&gt; 3 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Take Our Company To The Next Level &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We've been the subject of dozens of magazine articles, TV news segments, online videos and awards. People are fascinated by our success so far. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But we're only getting started. We're about to take online education to a whole new level. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Currently, our team is just 19 people. To achieve our ambitious goals we’ll need to hire many more. And these hires will make or break the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That means your work will be critical to the future of our company. &lt;/p&gt; 4 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stay In Control Of Your Schedule &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every job will occasionally have emergencies and important deadlines causing you to work long hours. That's normal. But it becomes a problem when long hours are the norm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That's not how we choose to work. We want (and even ask) our team members NOT to work long hours. That's because we're building our team for the long run. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join our team, and you’ll stay in charge of your schedule. &lt;/p&gt; 5 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Stability You Can Count On &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Most startups have huge ambitions – but little or no revenue. If you've spent years of your life in an exciting new project that never really took off, you already know how frustrating it can be. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School has been highly profitable for years. We’ve never taken investor money. Our rapid growth has been funded by sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; You won’t have to worry about our company running out of money. &lt;/p&gt; 6 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Perks That Make A Difference &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To get the best results, we have to offer the best possible work conditions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Things like a top-of-the-line laptop, automated solutions for repetitive tasks, and investing in your education make your work more valuable. So providing them is a no-brainer for us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We also want you to have a sense of belonging to our team. Even if you work remotely, you'll get to meet your coworkers in person at our regular team retreats. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Whether it's rafting through the wilderness, sailing to a remote island, or participating in an ancient sauna ritual, you’ll remember these adventures for years to come. &lt;/p&gt; 7 &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Join A Company You Truly Believe In &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Many people don't believe that their company creates a positive impact on the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But our company is different. We help millions of people take better photos. And we make the most beautiful online courses in the world (you can watch a sample video below). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Every week we receive hundreds of heartfelt thank-you notes from our students saying we helped fill their lives with the joy of photography. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join us, and you'll work for a company you truly believe in. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; What Will You &lt;br/&gt; Do As A &lt;br/&gt; Hiring &lt;br/&gt; Specialist? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We get more than a thousand job applications each month. This number will continue to grow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Your job will be to review these applications and decide whether we want to continue the hiring process with each candidate. You’ll also interview the successful candidates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Over time, we'll be happy for you to take on more responsibilities in hiring. The more steps of the hiring process you can handle independently, the better it is for the company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Here’s What We Expect From You &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;li&gt; We can trust your decisions in the hiring process &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can carry out professional job interviews independently &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have the patience to go through hundreds of job applications per day &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You can “sell” our company to job applicants &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; You have an eye for what makes a photograph or a video clip visually appealing (you’ll often have to evaluate applications for visual jobs such as video editor) &lt;/li&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is a full-time position. You can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our beautiful office in Riga, Latvia, or any paradise location. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you delay submitting your application, &lt;br/&gt; someone else will be hired before you. &lt;/p&gt;]]></content>
